有时候  童年对我来说如此遥远
Some days, my childhood feels so very far away.

19
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,840
其他时候
And others,

20
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,800
却又感觉历历在目
I can almost see it.

21
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,770
养育我的那片神奇土地
The magical land of my youth,

22
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,110
宛如一场美梦
like a beautiful dream

23
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,220
那时世界于我  有无限希望
of when the whole world felt like a promise

24
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,860
而未来的教训  尚未得预见
and the lessons that lay ahead yet unseen.

25
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,200
回顾童年  我真希望自己用心倾听
Looking back, I wish I'd listened.

26
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,010
真希望自己更仔细地
Wish I'd watched more closely

27

观察和体会
and understood.

但有时候  直到拨云见日
But sometimes you can't see what you're learning

才会豁然开朗

尽力就好
Just do your best.

38
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,960
你要记住
And remember,

39
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,360
伟大并非你所想的那样
greatness is not what you think.

40
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,670
找准节奏  耐心观察
Pace yourself and watch.

No!

-你作弊了  戴安娜  -不  但那...
- You cheated, Diana. - No. But that...

47
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,540
那才是真相
That is the truth.

48
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,150
是唯一的真相  真相就是一切

但你没有赢
But you didn't.

51
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,010
你不可能赢  因为你还没准备好
You cannot be the winner, because you are not ready to win,

52
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,320
这没什么好羞愧的
and there is no shame in that.

53
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,120
心中明知真相却拒绝接受
Only in knowing the truth in your heart

54
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,750
那才是可耻的
and not accepting it.

55
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,890
谎言中诞生不出真正的英雄
No true hero is born from lies.

56
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,760
你的胜利会到来的  戴安娜
Your time will come, Diana.

57

什么时候
When?

58
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,250
等你准备好后
When you're ready.

以黄金战士阿斯忒瑞亚为榜样
Look to the Golden Warrior Asteria.

60
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,170
她不是靠急功近利成为传奇的
She did not become a legend out of haste.

61
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,820
她凭借的是真正的勇敢之举
She did it through true acts of bravery.

62
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,420
比如耐心  勤勉
Like patience, diligence,

63
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,440
以及面对真相的勇气
and the courage to face the truth.

64
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,100
总有一天  你会实现自己的梦想  超出梦想
One day, you'll become all that you dream of and more,

142
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,480

-不  不  -不

What? Who? What?

145
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,970
今天可不玩那一套
We won't be doing that today.

146

We... We... We should go...

147

I hate guns.

150
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,250
我们得走了  快点
We've got to go now. Come on.

151
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,310
我错了  女士
I'm sorry, lady.

152
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,830

I'm sorry. Okay?

153
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,380
都是他的主意
It was his idea.

154
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,800
当局还有不少疑问
And the authorities still have questions.

155
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,680
首当其冲的疑问就是
In fact, the first is a real doozy, which is,

156
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,800
究竟是谁阻止了这起犯罪
who exactly even stopped this crime?

157
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,050
如果现场流传的说法可信
If the story around here is to be believed,

158
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,960
那么阻止犯罪的不是警方
it wasn't the police,

159
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,970
而是多名目击者看到的
but a mysterious female savior

160
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,960
一位神秘的女性救星
that multiple witnesses saw.

161
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,590
如果这事听来耳熟  那就对了
If this sounds familiar, it should.

162
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,590
自去年以来  华盛顿及周边地区

164
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,680
这就引出了今天最大的疑问
Which, of course, begs the biggest question of today,

165

昨天的商场劫案

213
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,210
据说那家珠宝店是个幌子

214
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,620
什么的幌子
Front for what?

215
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,800
黑市  向私人买家出售被盗珠宝和艺术品

226
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,470

227
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,290

230
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,200
没关系
Oh, it's okay.

231
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,120
找到了
Here it is.

232
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,490
是什么
What is it?

233
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,460
我看不出来
I can't tell.

234
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,670
来点灯光
Some light.

235
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,620
我觉得用专业术语来说应该是
I think the technical term here

236
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,330
"超级没劲"
is "extremely lame."

237
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,660
这是黄水晶
It's... It's citrine.

238
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,350
从古至今广泛用于造假的石头
A classic stone used in fakes throughout history.

239
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,090
我看这东西价值最多75美元
I can't imagine this is worth any more than $75.

240
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,120
你觉得呢
What do you think?

241
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,180
鉴伪不是我的专长  不过我来看看
Fakes aren't my forte, but let me see.

242
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,590
拉丁语
Latin.

243
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,280
好歹是个古董吧
At least it's an antique, right?

244
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,610
也可能是上周在佛罗伦萨老桥上的摊位买的
Or a purchase from a stall on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

245
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,010
谁知道呢
You never know.

246
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,120
"握持此物  许一宏愿"
"Place upon the object held but one great wish."

247
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,530
你会拉丁语
You read Latin?

248
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,670
是的  语言算是我的爱好
Yeah. Yeah. Languages are a hobby.

249
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,520
也许这是个幸运物
So maybe it's, like, a lucky charm or something?

250
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,650
大概是吧
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,680
真奇怪
Strange.

252
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,380
我真希望能喝杯咖啡
I really wish I had a coffee.

253
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,010
你真幽默
You're funny.

254
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,730
我给艾瑞卡买了杯咖啡  但她请病假了
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's out sick.

255
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,910
有人要喝吗
Does anybody want this?

256
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,980
什么  好啊  我来喝
What? Yeah, I'll take one.

257
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,160

Ooh, hot! Hot, hot!

258
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,310
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

259
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,020
如果这是真货  你能想象吗
Can you imagine?

260
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,480
如果是真货就好了
If only.

261
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,720
愿望太多  我都不知道该许哪一个
So many things, I don't even know what I would wish for.

262
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,430
我知道
I do.

263
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,330
好了  抱歉打扰你了
Well, um, anyway, sorry to bother you.

264

谢谢你刚刚...
But thank you for...

267
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,870
不用客气  这是我的工作
That's okay. It's my job.

268
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,110
等我有机会了再深入研究
And I'll look into it more when I have a chance.

269
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,820
好的
Okay.

270
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,690
谢谢你...
Well, thanks for...

271
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,950
主动跟我说话
talking to me.

真不好意思
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

273
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,600
我没事了
I mean, I'm fine.

274
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,130
话说  我们可以早点去吃晚饭
You know, we could go and grab early dinner

275
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,120
聊聊这块石头有多没劲
and talk about exactly how lame that stone is.

276
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,570
真的吗
Really?

277
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,540
真的  黄水晶  不是吧
Yeah, I mean, citrine?

278
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,670
这能唬住谁啊
Who are they kidding, right?

279
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,310
-太没劲了  -真傻
- So lame. - Dorky.

280
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,560
-超没劲  -是啊  我们走
- Lame. - Yeah, let's go.

281
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,270
真是没劲中的没劲
That's, like, the lamest of lames.

282
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,050
你太幽默了
You're so funny.

283
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,980
谢谢
Thank you.

284
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,380
已经很久没人让我笑得这么痛快了
I mean, no one's made me laugh like this in such a long time.

285
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,270
确实  我不怎么出门社交
I mean, it's true, I don't get out much socially.

286
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,170
-你不怎么出门  -对  不常出门
- You don't get out much? - No, not really.

287
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,970
-对  -抱歉  我有点惊讶
- No. - I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

288
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,730
因为你看起来像是那种
Because you just seem like the kind of person

289
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,450
从不回家的人
who's, like, always out.

290
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,780
天天都有人约你出去
Like, people are asking you to go out all the time

291
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,120
你经常出门  总在外面
and you live out. You're just out.

292
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,050
从来不待在家里
Like, you never get in.

293
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,950
你看起像是非常受欢迎的人
You just seem like you'd be really popular.

294
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,680
我能看出来  因为我从来都不受欢迎
And I would know because I've never been popular.

295
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
你不受欢迎
You haven't?

296
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,320
你这么好相处
You're so personable.

297
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,940
这么自由
So... free.

298
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,180
说真的  我挺羡慕你的
I mean, honestly, I gotta say that I envy that.

299
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,990
什么
What?

300
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,570
你羡慕我  这根本说不通
You envy me? That doesn't make any sense.

301
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,220
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

302
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,640
大家觉得我很奇怪
People think I'm weird.

303
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,210
他们当面躲着我  背后说我坏话
They avoid me and talk behind my back

304
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,450
以为我听不见
when they don't think I can hear them.

305
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,610
我真想说  "我听得一清二楚"
I'm like, "Guys, I can hear you."

306
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,180
芭芭拉  我的生活
Barbara, my life

307
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,670
大概和你想象的不太一样
hasn't been what you probably think it has.

308
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,280
我们都有自己的难处
We all have our struggles.

309
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,160
是啊
Yeah, we do.

310
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,140
你谈过恋爱吗
Have you ever been in love?

311
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,020
谈过
Yeah.

312
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,820
很久很久以前
A long, long time ago.

313
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,370
你呢
You?

314
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,940
我是情场老手了

都会是你的  但是记住

471
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,290
罗马不是一天建成的  对吧

但是已经过去很多天了吧

你爸爸要成为超凡卓绝的头号人物
Well, it takes time to become a great, great, number-one man,

474
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,980
这是要花时间的
like your dad is going to be.

475
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,490
不仅骗别人  还要骗儿子吗
Are you lying to your son, like you lie to everyone else?

476
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,030
西蒙

我知道你现在很难明白
I know it's hard to see right now, but

但是我们终于
we are finally right

484
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,340
快要扭转局面了
at the edge of turning this thing around.

485
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,100
"扭转局面"
"Turning it around"?

486
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,600
根本没有石油  从来就没有
There is no oil. There never was.

487
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,040
你打算怎么扭转局势
So how are you gonna turn it around?

488
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,510
再去骗几个我这样的倒霉投资人吗
Get more sucker investors, like me?

489
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,360
-这叫庞氏骗局  -不是
- It's called a Ponzi scheme. - No!

490

There's something in the works.

00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,870
而且不是骗局
And it's no scheme.

493
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,700
西蒙  我们有数百万英亩的潜在油田
Simon, we have millions of acres of potentially oil-rich land.

494
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,030
你的石油开采权
You have oil rights on land

495
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,260
都是在别人放弃不要的土地上
that everyone else passed on already.

496
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,440
查清这事没费多少功夫
Now, it didn't take much digging to find that out.

497
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,960
我也该早点查查你的底细

没用多久就查出来
Didn't take long to find out you're nothing

500
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,390
你不过是个卑劣的骗子
but a lowlife con man.

501
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,180
我不是骗子
I am not a con man!

502
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,380

限你48小时内

509

510
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,720
否则联邦贸易委员会将收到匿名举报

511
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,930
-窝囊废  -西蒙  等等
- Loser. - Simon, wait.

512
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,210
西蒙  等等
Simon, wait.

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,880
我不是窝囊废
I am not a loser.

514

他是骗子
He's a liar...

517
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,050
而且他错了
and he's wrong.

518
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,480
他会后悔离开了我
And he will rue the day he walked away from me.

519
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,850
而你
And you...

520
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,880
你会为有我这个爸爸而骄傲
You are going to be so proud to be my son.

会不会太紧了
Do you think it's too tight?

536
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,800
我觉得恰到好处
I think it's just right.

537
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,820

来这种场合应酬
go to these sort of things for work a lot,

547
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,090
所以这条裙子我穿过无数次了

548
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,210
其实不是的

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,470

我从没这么打扮过  从来没有

557
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,770
没错
Yeah, no.

558

尤其是你这样的漂亮女人
Especially not a beautiful woman like you.

559
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,680
天啊  这里太吵了
God, it's so loud in here.

560

那是什么
What is that?

568
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,350
不是什么特别的东西  真的
It's nothing special, really.

569
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,450
但联调局让我帮他们鉴定它
But the FBI did ask me to help them identify it.

570
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,480
不过到目前为止  我毫无头绪
Though it certainly has me stumped so far.

571
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:57,780
我来帮你
Let me help you.

572
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,650
麦克斯来了  马上帮你理清头绪

575
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,800
上面是拉丁语吧
It is Latin, isn't it?

576
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,100
我真的不能让它离开博物馆
I really shouldn't let it go out of the museum.

577
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,490
-你好  美人  -不了  谢谢  失陪
- Hey there, beautiful. - No, thank you. Excuse me.

586
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,860
戴安娜
Diana.

587
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,040
不好意思  我根本不认识你  别再跟着我了
Excuse me, I don't even know you, so please stop following me.

588

你为什么说这句话
Why did you say that?

591
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,590
别对我说这句话
Don't say that to me.

592
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,310
你根本不认识我
You don't even know me.

593
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,750
我认识
Yes, I do.

594
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,020
我来拯救今天
I can save today...

595
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,250
你来拯救世界
but you can save the world.

596
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,400
史蒂夫
Steve?

597
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,150
戴安娜
Diana.

598
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,090
怎么可能
But how?

599
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,810
我不知道
I don't know.

600
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,960
天呐
Oh, my God.

601
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,150
是你
It's you.

602
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,840
我好想你
I missed you.

603
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,430
你还记得什么
So what do you remember?

604
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,940
我记得...
I remember...

605
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,920
我记得把飞机开上天
I remember taking the plane up...

606
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,050
然后
and then...

607
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,040
就什么都不记得了
nothing, really.

608
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,500
一片空白
Nothing.

609
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,460
但我却知道自己之后就去了一个地方
But somehow, I know I've been someplace since then.

610
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,960
一个...
Someplace that's, uh...

611
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,390
我难以形容
I can't really put words to it.

612
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,530
但很好的地方
But it's... It's good.

613
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,480
然后我在这里醒来
And then I, uh... I woke up here.

614
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,440
哪里
Where?

615
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,830
一张床上
I ended up in a bed.

616
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:17,500
奇奇怪怪的床  软绵绵的  架在板条上
Strange, strange pillow bed with slats.

617
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,230
-那是床垫  -床垫
- A futon, yeah. - A futon?

618
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,570
-对  -好
- Yeah. - Yeah.

619
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:25,660
不太舒适  感觉时代有点倒退了
Well, not comfortable. And really a bit backwards

620
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,890
我和你说实话
if I'm being really honest with you.

621
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:30,430
毕竟现在是未来时代了  现在是19...
I mean, for a futuristic time like this. Nineteen...

622
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,290
84年  1984年
Eighty-four. 1984.

623
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,190
太惊人了
That's amazing.

624
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,440
你想来看看我的床垫吗
Would you like to see my futon?

625
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,880
好吧
Yeah. Um...

626
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,820
不用你多说
You don't have to tell me.

627
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,570
这地方乱糟糟的
The place is a mess.

628
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,130
瓶装奶酪
Cheese on demand.

629
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,460
我一上午都在打扫他的卧室
I spent all morning cleaning his bedroom, but

630
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,530
他似乎是个工程师
he seems to me to be an engineer.

631
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,440
有很多他自己的照片
Lots of pictures of himself.

632
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,750
我不会干这种事  但人各有所好吧
Not what I would do, but to each his own.

633
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,110
你就是这样找到我的
So this is how you found me.

634
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,220
对  用电话簿
Yeah, the phone book.

635
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,730
有些东西永远不过时
I guess some things are just future-proof.

636
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,430
你去我家找我了吗
So you went to my apartment?

637
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,920
对  一开始我想骑这辆单车去
Yeah, I tried to use the bike at first.

638
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,880
但不管我怎么蹬它都原地不动
I couldn't really figure out how to get it going,

639
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,170
所以我跑过去了  正好看到你回家
so I ran over and saw you come back.

640
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:03,230
然后我惊呆了
And I was stunned.

641
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,510
你就在眼前
There you were.

642
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,690
于是我就...
So I just, uh...

643
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,930
像个变态一样跟踪了你
followed you, like a creep.

644
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,110
戴安娜  看看你...
Diana, look at you. It's...

645
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,980
时光没留下一丝痕迹
It's like not one day has passed.

646
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,740
你可是大变样了
I can't say the same thing about you.

647
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,960
是啊  是啊
Right, right, right. Right.

648
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,840
嗯  他...
Yeah, he's, uh...

649
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,030
他还行吧
He's got it.

650
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,660
我喜欢他
No, I like him.

651
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:17,720
他挺好  但我眼中只有你
He's great, but all I see is you.

652
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,120
"许一宏愿"  我盼望已久了
"One great wish." I've been waiting.

653
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,580
我希望成为你
I wish to be you.

654
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,310
梦想石本身
The Dreamstone itself.

655
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,020
过来
Come here.

656
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,910
-早上好  -早上好
- Good morning. - Good morning.

657
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,880
我醒来后一直在吃果酱馅饼
Been eating Pop-Tarts all morning,

658
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,650
还喝了大概三壶咖啡
and I've had about three, three pots of coffee.

659
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:11,410
这地方太棒了
This place is amazing.

660
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,480
-这地方  -是啊
- This place? - Yeah.

661
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,790
好好想想的话
You know, if I really think about it,

662
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,950
我从没住过比这更棒的房间
I don't think I've ever been in a room more amazing.

663
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,750
-你说得对  -是啊
- It's true. - Yeah.

664
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,080
这是我这辈子住过最棒的房间
This room is the most amazing place I've ever been in, in my entire life.

665
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,770
这地方真的是最棒的  对吧
It is the most amazing place, right?

666
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,380
所以我们应该待在这里不走了
So let's, let's stay. We shouldn't go.

667
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,750
-我真的不想走  -所以别走了
- I really don't want to. - So, let's not.

668
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,000
-好  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

669
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,770
我们就待在这里
Let's just stay here.

670
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,040
我们就待在这里
Let's just stay here.

671
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,380
永远
Forever.

672
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,710
但是
Although...

673
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,110
我或许应该去查清楚
I should probably go and figure out

674
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,460
一块石头是怎么借用别人的身体
how a stone brought my boyfriend back

675
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,470
把我的男友带回来了
in someone else's body.

676
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,600
有道理  走吧
That's a fair point. Let's go.

677
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,540
斯塔格先生
Mr. Stagg?

678
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,880
谢谢  贝琳达
Thank you, Belinda.

679
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,540
天呐
Oh, God.

680
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,030
你最好是来还我钱的
You'd better be here with my money.

681
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,900
我会还你钱的  西蒙  但要先道歉
I'll have your money, Simon. Today, I'm here for an apology.

682
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,600
你疯了吗  我才不会道歉呢
Are you out of your mind? I'm not going to apologize.

683
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,720
对不起
I'm sorry.

684
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,700
我搞砸了  我搞砸了  我骗了你
I messed up. I messed up. I lied.

685
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,030
对不起
And I'm sorry.

686
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,980
事实上  我早就知道我们会血本无归
You know, the truth is, i knew we were going to sink a long time ago.

687
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,060
探测油井一无所获
The wells were coming up dry.

688
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,100
也没有数据提示可能发现石油
And no data suggested that was going to change.

689
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,270
那时我就应该收手的
I should have folded then.

690
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,420
但是为了所有入伙的人  相信我的人
But all the people that bought in, that believed in me.

691
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,230
-我想要扭转乾坤  -拜托
- I wanted to do right. - Oh, come on.

692
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,920
麦克斯  你不用...
Max, look, you don't have to...

693
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,150
西蒙  你难道不理解我希望成就更多吗
Simon, don't you understand that I wished for better?

694
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,230
我体内的每一个细胞
That with every ounce of my being,

695
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,900
都希望黑金能为我们所有人改变这个世界
I wished that Black Gold would change the world for all of us.

696
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,970
我知道这也是你的愿望
And I know you wished that, too.

697
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,820
这当然也是我的愿望
Of course I wished that, too.

698
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,670
那么你的愿望实现了
Then your wish is granted.

699
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,400
作为回报  你这个阻碍
And in return, I'll take all of your shares...

700
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,980
会被神奇地铲除掉
and full control of Black Gold,

701
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,810
将黑金公司的股份和控制权全部交给我
after you are somehow magically removed from my path...

702
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,990
-你说什么  -永远不回来
- You're gonna what? - ...forever.

703
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,610
麦克斯
Max!

704
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,820
麦克斯
Hey, Max!

705
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,020
回来  麦克斯
Get back here! Max!

706
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,920
到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

707
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,490
我们有西蒙·斯塔格的拘捕令
We have a warrant for Simon Stagg.

708
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,060
天呐  我们有危险吗
My word. Are we in danger?

709
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,770
没事  先生  这是联邦税务犯罪
No, sir. Federal taxation crime.

710
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,370
与你无关  快走吧
It doesn't concern you. Move along.

711
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:41,820
让他们过去
Send them through.

712
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,250
-好  跟我来  -我们走
- Okay. Follow me. - Let's go, guys.

713
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,640
你说这一切的源头是一块石头
So you said a stone started all of this?

714
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,020
对  这正是我们要调查的
Yeah, that's what we need to go and find out.

715
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,050
肯定跟它脱不了关系
I mean, it must have done something.

716
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:11,120
这身棒极了
This is dynamite.

717
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:12,620
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

718
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,980
-还行吧  -是吧
- Yeah. Yeah... - Huh? Right?

719
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,060
我在杂志上看到过  袖子要卷上去
I saw a couple of magazine pictures. They roll these up.

720
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,970
应该还有更好的
I think we can do better.

721
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,880
看看这些口袋  这里有口袋
Look at all the pockets in this. There are pockets here.

722
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,500
这条裤子上到处都是口袋
There are pockets all over the pant.

723
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,010
位置可调的美国式腰包
American issue bag, adjustable.

724
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:29,580
降落伞裤
Parachute pants?

725
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,660
-嗯  -现在人人都会跳伞吗
- Yeah. Uh... - Does everybody parachute now?

726
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,100
其实我对这身不太感冒
You know, I'm not so keen on this one.

727
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,880
但我觉得你会喜欢  就这身吧
I figure you are, but you know what, I'm ready to go.

728
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,730
-如何  -不行
- Right? - No.

729
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,710
-你看都不看一眼  -不合适
- You're not even giving it a second. - It's not good.

730
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,630
太夸张吗  是惊人还是吓人
"Too much" in a good way or a bad way? Right?

731
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,800
太吓人
In a bad way.

732
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:51,810
这才像样
Now that's great.

733
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,730
太好看了
It's beautiful.

734
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,300
是吗  我绝不会穿这身出门
Yeah. I would absolutely never wear it.

735
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,050
-我像是个海盗  -史蒂夫
- I feel like a pirate. - Steve.

736
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,550
谁会穿成这样
Who would wear this?

737
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:01,860
戴安娜
Diana,

738
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,230
你快看这双鞋

-鞋就穿着吧  -鞋可以穿  太好了

-鞋没问题  -太棒了
- Let's keep the shoes. - Yes!

741
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,080

This is a special one, okay?

742
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,100
我们一起来
Let's do this together.

743
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,320

Steve, you're gonna fall.

748
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,850
我真的以为会摔下去呢
I really thought I was gonna fall.

749
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,510

00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,980

753
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,260
-没事的  只是个舞蹈动作  -是吗
- It's fine. It's just a move. - Yeah?

754
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,260
没事的
It's nothing.

755
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,640
这些都是艺术品
It's all art.

756
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,480

它还在你这里吗

817
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,330
这事说来话长
Long story, actually, about that.

818
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,330

826
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,800
他又不是什么陌生人
It's not like he's a stranger or anything.

827
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,900
而且他有个朋友是专家  于是...
Plus he has a friend who's an expert, and I don't know...

828
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,570
你在说什么  你怎么能借出去呢
What do you mean? How could you loan it?

829
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,030
那根本不是我们的东西
It's not even ours to loan.

830
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,990
你干嘛冲我嚷嚷
What are you getting on my case for?

831
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,450
我办公室多得是比那石头珍贵的东西
I've got 15 things in my office more valuable than that stone.

832

833
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,320
完全不知道
No, I have no idea.

834
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:24,280
那我们有发现再通知你
Then I'll tell you what we find out.

835
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,030

842
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,110
这些人在干什么
What are these people doing?

843
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,140
不管怎样
Whatever it is,

844
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,680
从那条路是进不去了

史蒂夫

-落满了灰尘  -是啊
- It's so dusty. - Yeah.

850
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:02,840
跟爆炸现场似的
It's like a bomb went off.

851
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,570
{\an8}商场劫案涉案古物运往史密森尼博物馆
有消息称珍贵文物失而复得

852
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,980
不论这是什么  他已经找了很久了
Whatever this is, he's been looking for it for a long time.

853
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,530
"握持此物"
"Place upon the object held."

854
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:37,660
怎么了
What is it?

855
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,960
这是众神的语言
The language of the Gods.

856
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,590
问题是  这是哪个神写的
Which God wrote it, is the question.

857
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,050
-谢了  -不客气
- Thanks. Oh, yeah. - Yeah. It's okay.

858
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,690
我还有点事  回头再聊  好吗
I gotta go do something. Okay. I'll talk to you. All right?

859
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:54,600
-喂  -芭芭拉  我需要你的帮助
- Hello? - Barbara, I need your help.

860
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,900
我需要你找出
I need you to find out

861
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,560
那块石头被发现的确切地点
exactly where that stone was found.

862
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,270
我要知道地点  明白吗
"Where" is what I need to know. You understand?

863
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:04,060
明白  我这就着手
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

864
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,320
谢谢
Thanks.

865
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,990
你的表情像撞见鬼了
You look like you saw a ghost.

866
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,780
的确撞见了
I did.

867
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,910
世上曾经有很多神
There were many Gods

868
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,720
他们出于不同的目的做不同的事
and they did different things for different reasons.

869
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,920
其中一件事就是制造这样的物品
One was making objects like this.

870
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,480
这个世界中有许多通用元素
There are universal elements in this world,

871
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,940
当它们被注入容器之中
and when they're imbued into something,

872
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:35,550
就会变得强大无比
they can become very, very powerful.

873
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,810
比如我的真言套索
Like my Lasso of Truth.

874
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,320
它的力量源泉是真相  而不是我
The truth is what powers it, not me.

875
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,560
真相的力量比我们都强大
The truth is bigger than all of us.

876
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:45,810
但是什么给了它力量
But what is this?

877
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,230
我不知道
I don't know. Uh...

878
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52,530
既然能带我回来
Brought me back.

879
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:58,540
也许是爱  或是希望
Love or hope...

880
01:05:59,260 --> 01:05:59,910
也许是吧
maybe?

881
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:01,960
也许是吧
Maybe.

882
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,720
不管是什么  我敢保证
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you

883
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,340
这对麦克斯韦尔·罗德而言太过强大
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

884
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:10,710
我们必须找到他
We need to find this guy.

885
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:21,770
看看这个
Look at this.

886
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,020
如果日期正确  他出发去开罗了
If this date's right, he's going to Cairo.

887
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,190
开罗
Cairo?

888
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,590
{\an8}旅客票根

889
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:31,070
对  大概是去谈合作吧
Yeah. Growth opportunity, you know?

890
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,040
{\an8}石油经济学人
新原油之王
赛义德·本·阿比多斯酋长
成为世界最大的私人石油所有者

891
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,360
"原油之王"
"King of Crude"?

892
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,780
旅程用时也太短了
How is this so fast?

893
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,120
现在有飞机能从这里直飞开罗吗
You have a plane that can fly from here to Cairo in one shot?

894
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,430
太厉害了
That is amazing.

895
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,840
是啊  但你不能坐飞机
Yeah, but we can't get you on one

896
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,460
因为你没有护照
because you don't have a passport.

897
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:46,720
我不想坐飞机
I don't want to get on one,

898
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,100
我想开飞机  我想开这个
I want to fly one. I want to fly the plane.

899
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,460
我想开这种飞机
I want to fly this plane.

900
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:52,510
行吗
Yeah?

901
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,240
我的天
Oh, my Betsy.

902
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,210
史蒂夫  这边
Hey, Steve, this way.

903
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,420
来了
Yeah.

904
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,210
瞧这大轮子
Look at these gams.

905
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,310
你挑一架吧
You wanna choose?

906
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,440
这架
This one.

907
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:49,690
我喜欢
I like it.

908
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:01,990
好了

好的
Okay.

910
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:10,790
不对
No.

911
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,420
搞定  很好
All right. Good, good.

912
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,220
燃料  燃料
Fuel, fuel, fuel.

913
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:18,970
好了  发动
Here we go. Engine.

914
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,390
豁出去了
Here goes nothing.

915
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,420
-肯  -怎么了
- Ken? - What?

916
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,870
有架飞机上跑道了
There's an aircraft on the runway.

917
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:43,960
什么叫"有架飞机上跑道了"
What do you mean, "There's an aircraft on the runway"?

918
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,800
呼叫进近管制员  这里是塔台
Approach, this is Tower.

919
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,260
有架未登记的飞机上了跑道
There's an unlisted aircraft on the runway.

920
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,160
你看到了吗
Are you seeing this?

921
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,600
-能飞起来吗  -当然  当然
- Can you get us up there? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

922
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,180
我得先加速
I just have to pick up speed first,

923
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,340
然后就起飞
and then I'll take off.

924
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:59,760
凭我的技术  他们休想找到我们
The way I fly, they will never find us.

925
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,270
-我忘跟你说了  -什么
- I forgot to tell you. - What?

926
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,700
雷达  三言两语解释不清
Radar. I can't explain now,

927
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,020
但我们去哪他们都能找到  黑夜里也一样
but they'll see us anywhere, even in the dark.

928
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,310
那他们会朝我们开枪吗
Well, will they shoot at us?

929
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,020
-这下糟了  戴安娜  -好吧
- Well, shit, Diana. - Right.

930
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,370

我父亲把整个天堂岛藏起来了

01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,780
隐形飞机
An invisible jet.

945

The instability in the oil community has resulted

1088
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,180
全国的汽油需求暴涨
in a nationwide run on gas,

1089
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,650
专家正做好准备迎接...
and experts are girding themselves...

1090
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:26,510
喂
Hello?

1091
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:27,880
芭芭拉  是我  戴安娜
Barbara, it's Diana.

1092
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,450
-你有没有...  -有  算是有点眉目
- Did you... - Yeah. Uh, well, sort of.

1093
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,120
我还没查明石头的具体来源
I haven't figured out exactly what the stone is,

1094
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,200
但我找到了相关的历史照片
but I've found historical images of it.

1095
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,070
哪里的照片
From where?

1096
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:39,550
怪就怪在这里
That's the weird thing.

1097
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:41,150
全球各地都有
From everywhere.

1098
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:44,970
它首先出现在约四千年前的印度河谷
It first appeared in the Indus Valley almost 4,000 years ago.

1099
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:47,700
公元前146年又在迦太基突然出现
It popped up again in Carthage in 146 BC.

1100
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,620
公元4年  库施帝国
Kush, 4 AD.

1101
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,670
罗慕路斯  西罗马帝国末代皇帝
Romulus, the last Emperor of Rome,

1102
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:54,830
他在476年被刺杀时手里就拿着这块石头
he had it on him when he was assassinated in 476.

1103
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:58,750
关于它的最后记载是在一座无名死城
The last record is in some previously unknown dead city

1104
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:00,150
在玛雅古城附近
near Dzibilchaltun.

1105
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,140
-玛雅文明  -是的
- The Mayans. - Yeah.

1106
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,430
总之  调查到后面都是不了了之
Anyway, it just led me to a bunch of dead ends,

1107
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:08,000
我的最后一条线索也不太可靠
and my last lead is not that promising.

1108
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,200
是什么
What's that?

1109
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,240
我找到了一张传单
A flier I found.

1110
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,020
在大使馆拿的
Grabbed it at the embassy.

1111
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:15,770
有个人声称自己是玛雅萨满
Some guy advertising to be a Mayan shaman.

1112
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,370
但他在银河唱片行隔壁
But he literally teaches a course

1113
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:19,650
非法占用的房子里授课
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

1114
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:22,230
-他知道那块石头的事  -他是这么说的
- And he knows about the stone? - So he says.

1115
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:24,430
我明天早上过去看看
I'm gonna go there in the morning.

1116
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:27,660
好  我们在那里见  谢谢你
Okay, we'll meet you there. And thank you.

1117
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:32,260
怎么了
What is it?

1118
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:36,220
那块石头走遍了世界
The stone has traveled the world

1119
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:38,080
似乎随机出现在不同的地方
to seemingly random and different places,

1120
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,470
-但那些地方都有一个共同点  -是什么
- but they all have one thing in common. - What?

1121
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:43,590
那些文明都被彻底瓦解了
Their civilizations collapsed catastrophically.

1122
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,720
找不出任何缘由
Without a trace as to why.

1123
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,040
你不会觉得是那块石头...
You don't think the stone could have...

1124
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,600
你确定吗
Do you?

1125
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:51,980
我不知道  史蒂夫
I don't know what to think, Steve.

1126
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:55,080
只能寄希望我是错的
I can only hope I'm wrong.

1127
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:21,340
{\an8}银河唱片行

1128
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,240
巴巴吉德
Babajide?

1129
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:33,020
-来得真快  -早
- That was fast. - Morning.

1130
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,430
你好
Hello.

1131
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:39,640
稍等
One second.

1132
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:44,160
你是玛雅人吗
So you're a Mayan?

1133
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:47,050
什么  我是世界公民
What? I'm a citizen of the world.

1134
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:47,310
{\an8}弗兰克·帕特尔

1135
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,280
这上面写着你叫弗兰克
It says your name is Frank.

1136
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:51,370
我了解的大多都是前世的事
Yeah. Most of what I know is a past-life thing.

1137
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,720
所以不是玛雅人
So that's a no.

1138
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,220
不过回答你的问题  没错
But to answer your question, yes.

1139
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,550
我的曾曾祖父
My great-great-grandfather

1140
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,160
给了我这个
left me this.

1141
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,500
我对此一窍不通  但是有人警告过我
I don't know everything about it, but I have been warned

1142
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:05,440
我最好别掺和进去
I'm better off that way.

1143
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,800
我知道的是  这块石头在数月间
What I do know is, it destroyed our people

1144
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,410
就毁灭了我们的族人
in a matter of months.

1145
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,940
几个幸存者埋掉了石头
The few survivors, they buried the stone,

1146
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:16,320
永世不得重见天日
never to be exhumed under any circumstances.

1147
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,840
-我能看看吗  -请便
- Can I see that? - Be my guest.

1148
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,410
怎么了
What?

1149
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:36,900
说的是什么
What is it?

1150
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:41,840
迪卡拉弗里亚·埃罗
Dechalafrea Ero.

1151
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:43,300
那是什么
What's that?

1152
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,150
一个很邪恶的神
A very bad God.

1153
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:48,450
谎言之神  多洛斯  门达修斯
The God of Lies, Dolos, Mendacius,

1154
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:50,560
欺骗公爵  他有很多名字
Duke of Deception. He's been called by many names.

1155
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,110
但如果是他赋予了石头魔力
But if he's the one who empowered that stone,

1156
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:54,480
其中肯定有诈
there has to be a trick.

1157
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,530
谎言和实现愿望有什么关系
What do lies have to do with granting wishes?

1158
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:58,920
它对我而言更像是块梦想石
It seems more like a Dreamstone to me.

1159
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:01,700
许愿骗局
Wishes with a trick.

1160
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:04,370
就跟《猴爪》里说的一样
"The Monkey's Paw."

1161
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:04,370
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}小说讲述有只猴爪能实现三个愿望
但许愿者会付出惨痛的代价

1162
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:06,530
小心你许下的愿望
Beware what you wish for.

1163
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:09,520
它会实现你的愿望  但也会夺走你最宝贵的财富
It grants your wish, but takes your most valued possession.

1164
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,280
戴安娜  你的力量
Diana, your powers.

1165
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:15,190
这说不通啊
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1166
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:17,220
有什么能比你的愿望更加宝贵
What's more precious than what you wish for?

1167
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,340
我们要如何才能阻止
How do we stop this?

1168
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,230
传说中说
The legend said

1169
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:21,520
要想阻止它  只能毁了石头
it can only be stopped by destroying the stone itself

1170
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,850
或者收回已经实现的愿望
or give back what was given.

1171
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,490
我的族人做不到前者
My people couldn't do the first thing

1172
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:26,430
也拒绝做后者
and refused to do the second.

1173
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,540
如今文明已经灭亡
Now the culture's destroyed.

1174
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,200
再也不复存在
Wiped from the face of the Earth.

1175
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,680
没有人放弃自己的愿望吗
No one renounced their wish?

1176
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,250
但石头已经被毁了
But the stone is already destroyed.

1177
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,160
什么  什么时候
What? When?

1178
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,640
"就在你眼前"
"You're looking at it."

1179
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:43,250
"就在你眼前"  麦克斯·罗德是这么对我说的
"You're looking at it." That's what Max Lord said to me.

1180
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:45,590
也许就是他
Maybe it's him.

1181
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:47,640
他和石头化为一体了
He's become it somehow.

1182
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,530
那怎么可能
But how would that happen?

1183
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:51,640
如果他许的愿是...
I mean, if he wished for...

1184
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,390
不  这太疯狂了  不可能
No, that's crazy. No.

1185
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:04,620
如果我们毁了石头
If we destroy it,

1186
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:07,290
消灭他
if we destroy him...

1187
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:09,610
所有的愿望都会被收回
all the wishes go back.

1188
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,520
你在说什么呢  不行
What are you talking about? No.

1189
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,590
我才不要参与这事  不行
I'm not gonna be a part of that. No.

1190
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:15,610
或者所有人都放弃愿望
Or if everyone renounces their wish.

1191
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:18,410
肯定还有更好的办法
No, there has to be a better way.

1192
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:20,220
不行
No.

1193
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,430
她说得对
She's right.

1194
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,600
我们现在掌握的信息还不够  不够
We don't know enough. We just don't know enough.

1195
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,780
但可以确定的是
But what we do know is that

1196
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,910
我们得在他实现更多愿望之前阻止他
we need to stop him before he grants any more.

1197
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:33,650
阻止他可能还不够  戴安娜
Stopping him might not be enough, Diana.

1198
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,260
已经有那么多愿望实现了
Wishes have been made.

1199
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:39,740
芭芭拉
Barbara?

1200
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:42,580
芭芭拉
Barbara?

1201
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,400
我根本就看不上他们
Like I want any of these people in the club anyway.

1202
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,710
能把他们赶走吗
Can we tell them they're not invited?

1203
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:55,730
不能  先生
No, sir.

1204
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:58,070
-联邦通讯委员会说我们不能...  -FCC啊
- The FCC said we couldn't... - Oh, the FCC.

1205
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:02,170
我还BBB  FBD呢
The BBB, the FBD.

1206
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:04,630
这是阻碍我成功的阴谋
It's a conspiracy against my success.

1207
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:07,200
他们眼红了  没错  下一个是谁
They're jealous. That's why. Who's next?

1208
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,590
-是谁  -你要找的人都来了
- Who's next? - Well, everyone you asked for,

1209
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,860
钟赖  克拉吉先生
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,

1210
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,790
还有抢了你广告时段的电视福音布道者
that televangelist who stole your slot.

1211
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:16,710
你今晚还要陪阿里斯特
And you have Alistair for the night.

1212
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:19,750
又要陪阿里斯特吗  我要陪他多少个周末啊
Alistair? Again? How many weekends do I have?

1213
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,620
你说什么时候  今晚吗
What? What? When? Tonight?

1214
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,600
他已经到了
He's here already.

1215
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,430
他妈妈和男友在一起
His mom is with her boyfriend.

1216
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,820
请钟先生进来
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.

1217
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:41,090
给阿里斯特买匹小马
And buy Alistair a pony.

1218
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:43,890
不  赛车  给他买辆赛车
No! A race car. Get him a race car.

1219
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,350
我们开始吧  赖
Let's get to it, Lai.

1220
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,070
告诉我
Tell me...

1221
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:52,090
你想要什么
what do you want?

1222
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,350
你的愿望是什么
What do you wish for?

1223
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:58,720
我吗  说真的
Me? Truly?

1224
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,790
苏联站在了伊朗一边
The Soviets have sided with Iran.

1225
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:06,650
随着动荡的蔓延  伊拉克正准备自卫
Iraq is preparing to defend ourselves, as unrest spreads.

1226
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:08,700
那你想要什么
And you need? What do you...

1227
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,470
你的愿望是什么
What do you wish for?

1228
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,860
性爱录像处理掉了
Consider the sex tape gone.

1229
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,150
该死的  如果我得继续这样
And God darn it, if I have to keep doing this

1230
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,490
一个接一个地问...
one by one, by one, by one...

1231
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:20,970
-你的健康状况如何  -这个...
- How's your health? - Well...

1232
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:21,820
算了
Forget that.

1233
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:23,940
把你整个教会的教徒
But I will take your entire congregation

1234
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,500
还有广告时段给我
and your time slot.

1235
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,740
我问你
Let me ask you,

1236
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:31,720
祈祷的时候  能不能让他们
when they pray, is there any way I could get all of them to...

1237
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,640
都握住我的手
join hands with me?

1238
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,330
让他们说"我希望"
And simply say, "I wish"

1239
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:37,210
而不是"我祈祷"
rather than, "I pray"?

1240
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:39,020
那样能行吗
Would that even work?

1241
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:39,860
我不明...
I don't...

1242
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:44,540
我要找个办法同时接触到很多人
I need to find a way to touch a lot of people at the same time.

1243
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:47,310
先生  警察来了
Sir. The police are here.

1244
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:49,390
他们认为你的安保团队没有行动权限
They're challenging the jurisdiction of your security team.

1245
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:51,140
天啊
Oh, God!

1246
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:54,650
这个不行  再找个人来
This isn't working. Bring in someone new.

1247
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:55,970
还有我儿子
And my son.

1248
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:57,480
你滚吧
You, beat it.

1249
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,820
阿里斯特
Alistair!

1250
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,210
我想你了  伙计
I've missed you, buddy.

1251
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:15,940
过来  跟爸爸坐下来  对不起
Come. Sit down with Daddy. I'm sorry.

1252
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:18,640
但是爸爸
But, your dad

1253
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:22,500
正处在千钧一发的时刻
is on the absolute precipice of everything.

1254
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:24,940
记得我跟你说过我会成为头号人物吗
Remember when I told you that I would be number one?

1255
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:27,160
你记得吗  你爸爸
Do you remember? Your dad?

1256
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,580
我现在胜利在望了
Well, I'm inches away.

1257
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,140
我知道这不容易  我知道
I know it's hard. I know.

1258
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:32,650
但听我说
But listen,

1259
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:35,350
我知道你的愿望是什么  我的愿望和你一样
I also know what you wish for, and I wish for it, too.

1260
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,450
你听到了吗  我的愿望和你一样
Do you hear that? I wish for it, too.

1261
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:38,720
我只希望能和你在一起...
I just wish I could be with you...

1262
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,860
不
No!

1263
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,870
唯一的愿望不能这么用  阿里斯特
You don't use your one wish like that, Alistair.

1264
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:47,780
你不能许愿要你已经拥有的东西
You don't wish for something that you already have.

1265
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,650
你要许愿变得伟大  获得成功
You wish for greatness, for success.

1266
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:52,670
这是我做这一切的目的
That's why I'm doing all of this.

1267
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:57,640
难道你不明白我伟大就是你伟大吗
Don't you see that my greatness is your greatness?

1268
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,640
那我希望你变得伟大
Then I wish for your greatness.

1269
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,060
不  不
No. No!

1270
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:19,290
谢谢你
Thank you.

1271
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,600
我非常爱你
I love you so much.

1272
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,000
我向你保证  总有一天
And I promise you, one day,

1273
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:27,170
一切都会有意义
everything is going to make sense.

1274
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:30,680
总有一天  你会感谢我的
And one day, you'll thank me.

1275
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,800
但是现在  我...
But right now, I, uh...

1276
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:37,100
我要你和爱默生待在一起  好吗
Right now, I need you to stay here with Emerson, okay?

1277
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:38,130
我很快就回来
I'll be back.

1278
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:39,490
你待在这里
You stay here.

1279
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,710
你  你
You. You.

1280
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:53,840
什么事  先生
Yes, sir?

1281
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,630
难道你不希望我今天能和总统会面吗
Don't you wish I had an audience with the President today?

1282
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:57,620
我当然希望
Of course I do.

1283
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:00,260
还有  很高兴你重视我的意见  先生
And can I tell you how happy I am that you value my opinion, sir?

1284
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:02,930
等一下  我之前问过你的愿望吗
Wait a minute. Have I asked for your wish before?

1285
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:05,050
昨天问过  我说想要一辆保时捷
Yesterday. A Porsche.

1286
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:06,930
你们这些助理怎么都想要保时捷
What is it with you aides and Porsches?

1287
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:08,220
你
You!

1288
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:11,130
这边
This way.

1289
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:18,250
路况如何
How's traffic?

1290
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:19,610
堵死了
Terrible.

1291
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:20,930
难道你不希望不堵吗
Don't you wish it wasn't?

1292
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:24,080
你所到之处都像摩西分开红海一样畅通无阻
And that everywhere you went parted like the great Red Sea?

1293
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:27,800
我当然希望  可惜那不可能
Of course I wish that. Sadly, ain't gonna happen.

1294
01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:37,850
你别跑
Hey, you! Stop!

1295
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:40,410
快回家  外面不安全
Come on in. It's not safe.

1296
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:42,490
沙特大使馆发生了暴动
There's a riot at the Saudi Embassy

1297
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:45,010
街上到处都是保时捷横冲直撞
and there are Porsches racing up and down the street.

1298
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:45,970
快走  这世界疯了
Come on. It's mad.

1299
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:48,470
但是我的奶牛
But my cows.

1300
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:52,350
我跟一个人说我想要一座农场
I told a man I wanted a farm.

1301
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,520
我可没说是在这里
I didn't mean here.

1302
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,330
等我一下
I'll be right back.

1303
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:44,270
{\an8}特雷弗农场

1304
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,240
戴安娜  我知道这很难
Diana, I know it's been hard.

1305
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,280
-你不知道  你不懂  -可是我们...
- You don't know. You don't. - But we...

1306
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:08,650
不能再这样下去了
It can't go on like this.

1307
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:10,770
-我没法跟你谈这件事  -我们不得不谈
- I can't talk about this. - We have to talk about it.

1308
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:13,140
史蒂夫  我没法谈这件事
Steve, I can't talk about this!

1309
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:20,770
我每天都在付出  付出一切
I give everything I have, every day.

1310
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:22,290
我也很乐意
And I'm happy to.

1311
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,710
唯独只有一个愿望
But this one thing...

1312
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:30,190
一直以来我想要的只有你
You're all that I've wanted for so long.

1313
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,860
我只想要你  只有你能让我快乐
You're the only joy I've had or even asked for.

1314
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:37,360
我很抱歉
I am so sorry...

1315
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,860
但这太荒唐了
but that's crazy.

1316
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:45,750
这世界上多得是
There's a world out there full of

1317
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,400
比我更好的男人
so many better guys, for one.

1318
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,770
比如这家伙  他怎么样
I mean, how about this guy? How about him?

1319
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:52,010
我不要他  我要你
I don't want him. I want you.

1320
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:55,950
为什么就不能满足我这一个愿望  史蒂夫
Why, for once, can't I just have this one thing, Steve?

1321
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,660
就这一个
This one thing.

1322
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,590
我觉得我们别无选择
I'm not sure we have a choice.

1323
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:06,930
我可以选择
Well, I do have a choice.

1324
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:09,340
我不能放弃你  不能
And I can't give you up. I can't.

1325
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:11,610
我也不会放弃  所以我们要阻止他
So I won't. So we need to stop him

1326
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,280
想办法保住你
so we can figure that out.

1327
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:15,660
一定有别的办法
There has to be another way.

1328
01:40:16,570 --> 01:40:17,870
一定有
Has to.

1329
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:36,590
真不可思议
This is incredible.

1330
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:42,880
那是什么
What's that?

1331
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,450
我那个世界的
From my culture.

1332
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:50,200
一个古代亚马逊战士的盔甲  我们最伟大的战士
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior. One of our greatest.

1333
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,580
很大啊  这是一整套吗
It's huge. This whole thing?

1334
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:56,400
这是什么材料做的
What is it made out of?

1335
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,440
我来告诉你
Here. Let me show you.

1336
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:00,710
把手给我
Give me your hand.

1337
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,890
你什么意思  我没有说谎
What are you talking about? I haven't lied.

1338
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,620
套索不仅能让你说真话
The Lasso does more than just make you tell the truth.

1339
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,580
还能让你看到真相
It can make you see it, too.

1340
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:15,370
她叫阿斯忒瑞亚
Her name was Asteria.

1341
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:17,450
她是我们最伟大的战士
She was our greatest warrior.

1342
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:21,870
人类奴役亚马逊人之后  我母亲解放了我们
When mankind enslaved the Amazons, my mother freed us.

1343
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,110
但是必须有人留下来挡住人潮
But someone had to stay behind to hold back the tide of men

1344
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:27,750
其他人才能逃往天堂岛
so the others could escape to Themyscira.

1345
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,290
我的族人用他们所有的盔甲
My people gave up all of their armor

1346
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:34,450
为她制作出一套能抵挡全世界的战服
to make her one suit strong enough to take on the whole world.

1347
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,660
阿斯忒瑞亚为他人的幸福牺牲了自己
And Asteria sacrificed herself for a better day for others.

1348
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:46,280
太...
That's...

1349
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,380
太不可思议了
That's incredible.

1350
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:52,480
我刚来这里时找过她
When I came here, I searched for her.

1351
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:55,200
但只找到她的盔甲
But all I could find was her armor.

1352
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,610
什么情况
What is this?

1353
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,230
他要去哪里
Where is he going?

1354
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:02,010
坏了
Oh, no.

1355
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,190
戴安娜  戴安娜  你要做什么
Diana, Diana! What are you doing?

1356
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:25,210
-你要去哪里  -史蒂夫  我得去  你留下
- Where are you going? - Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.

1357
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:26,980
不  不  听我说
No. No. Listen to me.

1358
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,750
你的力量越来越弱了  戴安娜
You're getting weaker, Diana.

1359
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:29,970
-万一你摔下去呢  -不会的
- What if you fall? - I won't.

1360
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:31,750
有可能会  我们都说不好
You might. We don't know that.

1361
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,780
一定有别的办法能进去
There has to be another way in.

1362
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,910
你没事吧  总统先生
Everything okay, Mr. President?

1363
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,580
没事
Yes.

1364
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:54,360
感觉好奇怪  我...
Something very strange. I...

1365
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:58,060
我以为我在另一个地方  突然...
I thought I was somewhere else entirely. Suddenly...

1366
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:02,630
总之  很忙乱
Anyway. Hectic times.

1367
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,070
你们回避一下
Give us a minute.

1368
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,520
让一下
Excuse me.

1369
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,940
-卡尔  -戴安娜
- Carl. - Diana.

1370
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,970
-你好  -真荣幸
- Hi. - What a pleasure.

1371
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:21,890
见到你真好  最近怎么样
Good to see you. How have you been?

1372
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:23,470
-很好  -这是史蒂夫
- Good. - This is Steve.

1373
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:26,540
史蒂夫  这是卡尔  我同事
Steve, this is Carl. My colleague.

1374
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,960
那我们...
Shall we, uh...

1375
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,680
好  走吧
Yeah, we shall.

1376
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:33,250
抱歉  罗德先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.

1377
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:35,440
说实话  我都不知道这次会面是要谈什么
In fact, I don't even know what we're supposed to discuss.

1378
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,780
就谈这个  总统先生
Exactly that, Mr. President.

1379
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:40,550
这忙乱的日子  狂热的时代
These hectic days, hectic times.

1380
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:42,970
还有你
And you.

1381
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:46,160
这些并不算白宫里我最喜欢的半身像
These aren't exactly my favorite of the busts on display here,

1382
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:48,180
但有张小画能排到我心目中的前十位
but it's a little picture of my top ten,

1383
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,060
勉强可以算前五
maybe top five at a push.

1384
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,400
前面的东西也许你会感兴趣
Oh, here's something up ahead that will interest you.

1385
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,970
这些地砖
These are floor tiles

1386
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:57,160
最初是简·林肯铺的
originally laid by none other than Jan Lincoln,

1387
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,220
一位不出名的亚伯拉罕后代
a little-known descendent of Abraham.

1388
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:02,420
你遇到麻烦了吧
You're having some troubles?

1389
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,810
麻烦突然无处不在
Everywhere suddenly.

1390
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:05,490
古巴  埃及
Cuba, Egypt,

1391
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:07,010
还有国内
even here.

1392
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,350
但苏联...
But Russia...

1393
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,550
特别棘手
very troublesome.

1394
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:14,860
我很感谢你的关心
I appreciate your concern,

1395
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:16,950
但现在再多的钱也帮不了我们
but all the money in the world won't help us now.

1396
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:18,590
我不是要给你钱
It's not money I'm offering.

1397
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:20,960
你
You.

1398
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,150
你是有信仰的人
You are a man of faith,

1399
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:27,460
而我最近非常幸运
and I have been very blessed lately.

1400
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,830
我想把我的运气分享给你
I want to share my blessing with you.

1401
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,760
这是正面思考的力量
The power of positive thinking.

1402
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:41,950
好了
Now...

1403
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:46,730
总统先生  告诉我你需要什么
tell me, Mr. President, what do you need?

1404
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:49,430
不是对着我说  而是对着宇宙说
And you're not speaking to me here, but to the universe.

1405
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,830
你的愿望是什么
What do you wish for?

1406
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:57,130
当然是想要更多
What is there to wish for but more?

1407
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:59,660
更多核武器  比他们更多
More nuclear weapons. More than they have.

1408
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,170
离他们更近
Closer to 'em.

1409
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:03,420
只要我有那些核武器
If I just had that in place,

1410
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,500
他们就必须听我们的
then they would have to listen to us.

1411
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:09,340
想法不错  那我就帮你实现...
A nice thought. And I grant you...

1412
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,560
天...
Oh, my...

1413
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,580
你知道我要什么吗
And you know what I'd like?

1414
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:25,530
我要你所有的势力  影响力  权力
I would want all of your power, influence, authority.

1415
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:27,010
所有人对你的尊敬
All the respect you command

1416
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:31,190
所有人对你的服从
and the command everyone must respect.

1417
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,740
还能有什么
I mean, what else is there?

1418
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:43,110
告诉你的手下
Now, tell your people I would appreciate

1419
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:46,790
绝对不要来干涉我
absolutely no interference whatsoever.

1420
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:49,260
没有税务和法律  没有任何限制
No taxes, no rule of law, no limits.

1421
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:53,920
把我当成一个有绝对自治权的国家
Treat me like a foreign nation with absolute autonomy.

1422
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,420
好的  先生
Very good, sir.

1423
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,050
马上就办
Right away.

1424
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:05,950
这是什么
What's this?

1425
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:07,680
全球广播卫星
Global Broadcast Satellite.

1426
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,390
这是个绝密计划  能让我们
Top-secret program that enables us

1427
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:11,710
控制全世界所有广播系统
to override any broadcast system in the world

1428
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:14,820
以防我们需要与敌国国民直接接触
in case we need direct contact with the people of an enemy state.

1429
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,420
这是什么意思
So what does that mean?

1430
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:18,700
你要控制所有人的电视吗
You're taking over everyone's TVs?

1431
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:19,940
怎么控制
How?

1432
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,680
使用粒子束技术
It uses particle beam technology,

1433
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,450
就像星球大战计划一样
just like the Star Wars program.

1434
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,450
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}美国80年代研议的
反弹道导弹军事战略计划

1435
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:26,540
据说在粒子信号覆盖的区域内
Apparently, it bathes the landscape in a signal of particles

1436
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:29,500
粒子可以进入并操控所接触到的任何设备
that goes in and fiddles with any technology it touches.

1437
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,870
不管设备新旧  想播放什么都可以
New or old. Broadcast whatever you want.

1438
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:34,520
非常厉害
Very impressive.

1439
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:38,200
你是说"接触"吗
You said "touches"?

1440
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:41,430
发送的这些粒子...
As in the particles you are sending...

1441
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:49,590
能接触一切吗
are touching everything?

1442
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:50,700
这是个比喻
It's a figure of speech,

1443
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:52,320
但没错
but yes.

1444
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,600
他们就是这样跟我解释的
That's how it was explained to me.

1445
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,790
我要立刻使用这颗卫星
I need immediate access to this satellite.

1446
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:57,760
派直升机送我过去
And a chopper to get me there.

1447
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,480
好的  先生  马上就办
Yes, sir. Right away.

1448
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:12,300
你还真是神通广大
Well, aren't you resourceful?

1449
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:15,370
趁你还没造成更多伤害  跟我走吧  麦克斯
Come with me before you do any more damage, Max.

1450
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:17,220
不  我不走
No. I don't think so.

1451
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,880
请把这个女人除掉
Remove this woman, please...

1452
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,290
别手软
permanently.

1453
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:31,750
-你没事吧  -不知道
- Are you okay? - I don't know.

1454
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,240
不  史蒂夫  你不能用这个
No, Steve. You can't use that.

1455
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,780
他们是无辜的
It's not their fault.

1456
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,260
这招不错
That's neat.

1457
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:02,640
芭芭拉
Barbara.

1458
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,900
我不能让你这么做  戴安娜
I can't let you do this, Diana.

1459
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:41,780
芭芭拉  什么
Barbara. What...

1460
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,890
-怎么...  -我不能让你阻止麦克斯
- How... - I can't let you stop Max.

1461
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:46,940
不是只有你的愿望会被收回
You're not the only one with something to lose.

1462
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:53,070
没想到许愿像你一样...
Turns out wishing to be like you...

1463
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:56,110
带来了惊喜
came with some surprises.

1464
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:00,430
举起手来
Hands up.

1465
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:02,420
-举起手来  -举起手来  举起手来
- Hands up. - Hands up, hands up.

1466
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,120
举起手来
Hands up!

1467
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,590
-举起手来  -快点
- Hands up! - Now! Now, now!

1468
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,420
开火
Open fire!

1469
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:38,570
真恩爱  保护自己的爱人
Oh, how sweet, defending your love. Huh?

1470
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:41,200
你的愿望是什么  变成真正的活人吗
What do you wish for? Do you wanna be a real boy?

1471
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,430
不
No.

1472
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,690
我希望别跟你铐在一起  但还是铐上了
Just not to be handcuffed to you, but now I am.

1473
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:54,350
我刚学会这招
I just learned that.

1474
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:08,360
芭芭拉  住手
Barbara, stop!

1475
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,950
听着
Listen.

1476
01:51:19,950 --> 01:51:21,360
你根本不明白自己许了什么愿望
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

1477
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,590
我不是你想的那样
I'm not what you think.

1478
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:24,190
你理解不了  也承受不了
You can't possibly understand or handle...

1479
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:26,400
我理解不了吗
Oh, I can't possibly understand?

1480
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,040
我这么傻
Dumb little old me.

1481
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,510
又傻又可怜
Dumb little, poor little

1482
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,560
没人在乎我
nothing, nobody me.

1483
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,450
我根本承受不了
I couldn't possibly handle it.

1484
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:41,040
不  芭芭拉  我不是这个意思
No, Barbara. That's not what I'm saying.

1485
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:49,800
我倒是感觉得心应手
Well, I'm handling it beautifully.

1486
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,880
我才不要放弃
And I'm not giving it back!

1487
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:17,100
走啊
Go.

1488
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:18,890
快跑
Run!

1489
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:21,380
你们都停手
Everyone, stand down.

1490
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:23,180
不许伤害她
Nobody hurts her.

1491
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,160
他们伤害不了我
They couldn't if they tried.

1492
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:34,220
你生来就拥有一切
You've always had everything,

1493
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,860
而我这样的人一无所有
while people like me have had nothing.

1494
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:41,840
现在轮到我了  你别想从我手中夺走
Well, now it's my turn. And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

1495
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,100
但你付出了什么代价
But what is it costing you?

1496
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:46,790
我付出了什么代价
What is it costing me?

1497
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:50,160
如果跟猴爪一样  那么代价与愿望同等
If it's the monkey's paw, it takes as much as it gives.

1498
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:54,840
对  你变强大了  但是
Yes, you're strong, but...

1499
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:57,320
你失去了什么  芭芭拉
what did you lose, Barbara?

1500
01:52:58,390 --> 01:53:01,670
你的热情  你的快乐
Where's your warmth, your joy,

1501
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:02,770
你的人性呢
your humanity?

1502
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:07,080
你攻击了无辜的人  芭芭拉  看看你自己
You're attacking innocent men, Barbara. Look at yourself.

1503
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,600
别说我了
Forget about me.

1504
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,470
你付出了什么代价
What is it costing you?

1505
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:20,650
明白了吧
That's right.

1506
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:23,580
好好习惯一下吧
Get used to it.

1507
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:28,670
如果你去追捕麦克斯·罗德
If you go after Max Lord...

1508
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:32,150
或者伤害他
or hurt him in any way,

1509
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,850
我会消灭你
I will destroy you.

1510
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:35,100
芭芭拉
Barbara!

1511
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:53,800
你还好吗
Are you all right?

1512
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:55,330
来
Come here.

1513
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:17,230
能加一个人吗
Room for one more?

1514
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,720
先生  你得等等
Sir, you need to wait.

1515
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,690
-总统现在正在开会  -我们要见总统
- The President has a meeting right now. - We need to see the President.

1516
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:31,230
他必须明白
 He needs to be told.

1517
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:33,330
-事关生死存亡  -怎么回事
- This is a matter of life and death. - What is going on?

1518
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:36,690
苏联的预警系统发现了我们的新核武器
The Soviets' early detection system picked up our new nukes.

1519
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:37,770
什么新核武器
What new nukes?

1520
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:41,140
一百枚核弹头刚被激活  准备发射
A hundred warheads just went online, ready to launch.

1521
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:43,260
他们认为这是战争行为
They're taking this as an act of war.

1522
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:45,070
正在准备反击
Prepping to return fire.

1523
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:46,970
反击  什么
Return? What?

1524
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:48,230
我们什么都没做
We haven't done anything.

1525
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:49,860
但看起来不是这样
That's not how it looks.

1526
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:52,220
如果处境对调  我们早就反击了
And we'd fire for less.

1527
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:56,860
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

1528
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:59,570
你闯红灯了  你看都没看
You blew through that light right there! You didn't even see!

1529
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:00,800
你眼瞎吗
How do you not see that?

1530
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,020
随着美苏两国
Riots across the world erupting

1531
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:06,510
终止对话  宣布开战
as America and the Soviet Union end communication,

1532
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:08,100
世界各地暴乱四起
declaring war!

1533
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:10,230
没人知道前因后果
No one knows any more than that.

1534
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:12,670
但是空前危机当前
But as you can imagine with what's at stake,

1535
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:16,450
华盛顿特区市中心陷入了疯狂之中
there has been madness down here in downtown Washington, D.C.

1536
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:18,390
国民警卫队已出动...
The national guard has been brought in...

1537

the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor

1541
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:30,120
之间的宾夕法尼亚大道路段
between 3rd and 12th streets northwest.

1542
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:41,630
我们面临的是大灾难的末期
It is the final days of tribulation that is happening to us now.

1543
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:41,630
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}《马太福音》中提到的事件
是上帝对世人的审判和净化

1544
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:45,460
你们看到自己罪行的恶果了吗
Can you see what your sinfulness has done?

1545
01:55:45,690 --> 01:55:47,310
你们的贪婪
Your greed?

1546
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:50,250
你得做点什么  你得做点什么
You gotta do something! You gotta do something!

1547
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:55,380
快  这边  快
Come on! This way! Come on!

1548
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,250
莱丽

全体人员
All units.

1550
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:03,390
莱丽
Riley!

1551
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:04,830
我们需要帮助

1552
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:08,400
-到处都一片混乱  -莱丽
- It's chaos out here. - Riley!

1553
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,090
你想让我怎么办  我不知道该怎么办
What do you want me to do? I don't know what to do.

1554
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:13,750
帮帮我
Somebody help me.

1555
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,240
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

1556
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,300
戴安娜

1557
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,020

我度过了精彩的一生
I had a great life.

1559
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,420
史蒂夫

1560
01:56:35,470 --> 01:56:37,380
而你让我的人生更美好了
And you only made it better.

1561
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:41,780
但你知道应该做什么
But you know what you need to do.

1562
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,710
这个世界需要你
The world needs you.

1563
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:51,470
-好吗  -不
- All right? - No.

1564
01:57:06,230 --> 01:57:07,740
我再也不会爱上别人
I'll never love again.

1565
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:09,400
我希望这话不是真的
I pray that isn't true.

1566
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:12,950
这个世界那么大  那么美好
There's a wonderful, big world out there.

1567
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:16,000
这个疯狂的新世界
This crazy new world.

1568
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:19,130
我很高兴能来看一看
And I am so happy I got to see it...

1569
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:22,320
但它值得你拯救
but it deserves you.

1570
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:34,620
我说不出再见
I can't say goodbye.

1571
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,890
我说不出再见
I can't say goodbye.

1572
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:40,020
你不用说
You don't have to.

1573
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:46,230
我已经不在了
I'm already gone.

1574
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:03,330
我会永远爱你  戴安娜
I'll always love you, Diana,

1575
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:05,000
无论我在哪里
no matter where I am.

1576
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:07,440
我爱你
I love you.

1577
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,720
我放弃我的愿望
I renounce my wish.

1578
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:09,300
很简单
It's easy.

1579
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:14,240
就是风和气流
It's only wind and air...

1580
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:17,830
驾驭气流
and how to ride it.

1581
01:59:20,490 --> 01:59:21,530
乘风而行
How to catch it.

1582
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:36,900
你也许愿了  是吧
You made a wish too, huh?

1583
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:42,790
愿望很狡猾  不是吗
They're a bitch, aren't they?

1584
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:44,880
必须付出代价
Make you pay a price, but

1585
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,660
但我从不遵守规则
I've never been one for rules.

1586
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:49,230
所幸我有逆转的办法
Luckily, I have a way to reverse it.

1587
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,900
永不满足才能生存
The answer is always more.

1588
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,650
但每人只能许一个愿望
But you only get one wish.

1589
02:00:54,650 --> 02:00:56,660
但实现愿望的人是我
But I, my dear, grant the wishes.

1590
02:00:57,490 --> 02:01:00,410
所以我能要求回报
So I take what I want in return.

1591
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:03,700
不管我想要什么  都能从别人身上夺取
There's nothing in this world someone doesn't have.

1592
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:07,210
我会重塑我的健康  用一个个愿望换一个个器官
I'll rebuild my health, wish by wish, organ by organ...

1593
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:09,210
如果有必要的话
if I have to.

1594
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:12,210
我将无人能敌
I'll be invincible.

1595
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:14,930
告诉我
Tell me,

1596
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,850
你想要什么
what do you want?

1597
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:19,600
我现在很慷慨
I'm feeling generous.

1598
02:01:23,390 --> 02:01:27,520
我不想再像任何人一样了
I don't want to be like anyone anymore.

1599
02:01:29,450 --> 02:01:31,080
我想成为头号人物
I want to be number one.

1600
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:36,340
顶级掠食者
An apex predator,

1601
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:39,720
前所未有的存在
like nothing there's ever been before.

1602
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:44,100
我喜欢你的想法
I like the way you think.

1603
02:01:45,970 --> 02:01:46,810
继续
Go on.

1604
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,530
你应该收到命令了吧
You heard we were coming, I presume?

1605
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:06,660
我一次能控制多少广播信号
How many broadcasting signals can I take over at once?

1606
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:09,080
你想控制多少都行  先生
Well, as many as you like, sir.

1607
02:02:09,450 --> 02:02:10,830
我要控制所有的信号
I'll take all of them.

1608
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:11,870
所有的吗
All of them?

1609
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:17,000
难道你不希望我能成功吗
And I sure wish this works for me. Don't you?

1610
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:18,550
当然希望  先生
Yes, sir.

1611
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:24,340
灯光  摄像机
Lights, camera...

1612
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:28,220
12号  9号  16号  开始传送
Okay, stations 12, 9, 16, go transmit.

02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:30,600
你们只要大声许愿
All you have to do is say it out loud.

1693
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:33,500
许下愿望  任何愿望
Make a wish. Any wish.

1694
02:11:33,930 --> 02:11:34,980
看着我的双眼
Look into my eyes,

1695
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:38,560
你们梦寐以求的一切  都能实现
and everything you've been waiting for, it's all yours.

1696
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:39,780
你来迟了
You're too late.

1697
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:42,940
实现了
Granted.

1698
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:45,320
实现了
Granted.

1699
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,950
实现了
Granted!

1700
02:11:48,910 --> 02:11:50,030
实现了
Granted!

1701
02:11:50,910 --> 02:11:53,660
-实现了  -你为什么要这么做
- Granted. - Why are you doing this?

1702
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:55,370
你拥有的还不够多吗
Don't you have enough?

1703
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:56,790
为什么不要更多
Why not more?

1704
02:11:57,330 --> 02:11:59,250
为什么不许愿要更多
Why not wish for more?

1705
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:01,630
但他们不知道你夺走了什么
But they don't know what you're taking from them.

1706
02:12:01,630 --> 02:12:03,710
想要就是想要
We want what we want.

1707
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:05,550
你也许愿了
Just like you did.

1708
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:08,800
许愿吧
So make a wish.

1709
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:10,510
很好
Very good.

1710
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,230
实现了
Granted.

1711
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:26,450
太迟了  戴安娜
It's too late, Diana.

1712
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,240
他们已经听到我的话
They already heard me.

1713
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:31,950
已经许下愿望
Already wished!

1714
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:36,200
那些还没许愿的人
And those that haven't yet...

1715
02:12:41,290 --> 02:12:42,710
也会许愿的
They will!

1716
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:57,690
实现了
Granted.

1717
02:12:58,810 --> 02:12:59,980
实现了
Granted.

1718
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,860
实现了
Granted.

1719
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:11,160
可怜的戴安娜
Poor Diana.

1720
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,060
为什么要逞英雄呢
Why be such a hero?

1721
02:13:15,830 --> 02:13:20,290
只要加入我的阵营
You could have kept your pilot and your powers,

1722
02:13:20,290 --> 02:13:23,240
你就能同时拥有爱人和力量
if only you'd join me.

1723
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:25,650
要不要重新考虑一下
Wanna reconsider?

1724
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:30,910
我是个宽宏大量的人
I'm a forgiving man!

1725
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:36,540
你想要他回来吗
You want him back?

1726
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,140
只要许愿就行了
Just say the word.

1727
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:41,900
你可以拥有一切
You can have it all!

1728
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:45,980
只要你想要
You just have to want it!

1729
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:51,490
我最想要的就是他
I've never wanted anything more.

1730
02:13:57,560 --> 02:13:59,110
但他已经不在了
But he's gone...

1731
02:14:00,830 --> 02:14:02,410
那才是真相
and that's the truth.

1732
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:06,110
万事皆有代价
And everything has a price.

1733
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:08,380
而我不愿付这个代价
One I'm not willing to pay.

1734
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:09,880
再也不了
Not anymore.

1735
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:21,670
这个世界本来就很美好
This world was a beautiful place just as it was...

1736
02:14:23,380 --> 02:14:25,170
没人能拥有一切
and you cannot have it all.

1737
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,880
你只能拥有真相
You can only have the truth.

1738
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,110
真相就足够了
And the truth is enough.

1739
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:35,450
真相是美好的
The truth is beautiful.

1740
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:41,000
所以看看这个世界
So look at this world...

1741
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:45,580
看看你的愿望让世界付出了什么代价
and look at what your wish is costing it.

1742
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,260
你一定要成为英雄
You must be the hero.

1743
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:53,430
只有你能挽救一切
Only you can save the day.

1744
02:14:55,930 --> 02:14:57,970
如果你想拯救这个世界
Renounce your wish

1745
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:00,890
那就放弃你的愿望
if you want to save this world.

1746
02:15:00,890 --> 02:15:02,810
我为什么要放弃
Why would I...

1747
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:06,610
好不容易轮到我
when it's finally my turn?

1748
02:15:08,730 --> 02:15:12,070
这个世界是属于我的
The world belongs to me!

1749
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:16,490
你阻止不了我  谁也阻止不了我
You can't stop me. No one can!

1750
02:15:17,790 --> 02:15:19,700
我不是在对你说话
I wasn't talking to you.

1751
02:15:27,670 --> 02:15:30,260
我是在对世界上其他所有人说话
I was talking to everyone else.

1752
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:38,600
因为并非只有你遭受痛苦
Because you're not the only one who has suffered.

1753
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:41,810
想要更多
Who wants more.

1754
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:47,230
想要逝者归来
Who wants them back.

1755
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:52,740
想要不再害怕
Who doesn't want to be afraid anymore.

1756
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:57,830
不再孤独
Or alone.

1757
02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:59,670
停下
Stop!

1758
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:02,490
切断信号  停下
Cut the signal! Stop!

1759
02:16:02,870 --> 02:16:04,410
不再恐惧
Or frightened.

1760
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:06,620
不再无力
Or powerless.

1761
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:09,330
因为并非只有你
'Cause you're not the only one

1762
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:14,330
希望世界变成截然不同的样子
who imagined a world where everything was different.

1763
02:16:19,090 --> 02:16:21,510
终于变得更好
Better. Finally.

1764
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:30,270
变成一个能感受到爱
A world where they were loved

1765
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:34,490
感受到理解与认同的世界
and seen, and appreciated.

1766
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:35,400
终于
Finally.

1767
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:37,660
天呐  他是谁
Oh, my God. Who is he?

1768
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:39,900
他连英语都不会说
He doesn't even speak English.

1769
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:41,660
他吃的是什么
What is he eating?

1770
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:43,410
快看他的鞋子
Look at his shoes!

1771
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:45,720
怪胎
Weirdo!

1772
02:16:57,060 --> 02:17:02,860
{\an8}黑金合作社

1773
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:07,270
可是你为此付出了什么代价呢
But what is it costing you?

1774
02:17:08,940 --> 02:17:10,650
你看到真相了吗
Do you see the truth?

1775
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:24,910
爸爸
Daddy!

1776
02:17:26,370 --> 02:17:27,560
爸爸

02:17:31,010 --> 02:17:33,220
{\an2}{\pos(192,215)}我们别无选择

1779
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:35,600

1780

俄国人正在发射导弹
The Russians are launching.

1781

我们受命进行反击
We've got orders to counter.

1782
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:43,280
好吧
All right, all right.

幸好我许愿要你回来

我就知道会实现的
I knew it would work.

1823
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:11,430
不
No.

1824
02:21:12,970 --> 02:21:14,720
不是愿望让我回来的
That is not why I'm back.

不
No.

1826

我一直都在骗你
I've been lying to you.

1827
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:23,610
我不是大人物
I'm not a great guy.

1828
02:21:25,530 --> 02:21:28,110
事实上  我是个糟糕透顶的窝囊废

1830
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:34,950
但是你
But you...

1831
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:40,580
你永远也不必许愿让我爱你
you don't ever have to make a wish for me to love you.

我回来是因为我爱你
I'm here because I love you.

1833
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:48,380
我...
I just...

1834

我希望  我祈祷有一天

我能让你为我感到骄傲

1837
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:58,730
能让你爱我

1838
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:02,320
因为我根本不值得骄傲  阿里斯特
Because I'm nothing to be proud of, Alistair.

1839
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:05,280
我不需要你让我感到骄傲
I don't need you to make me proud.

1840

02:22:57,740 --> 02:22:59,830
-抱歉  -抱歉
- Sorry. Sorry. - Sorry.

1843
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:03,000
没事  没事
It's okay. It's okay.

1844
02:23:07,710 --> 02:23:09,210
太美了
So beautiful.

1845
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:18,850
抱歉  我在自言自语
Sorry. Just talking to myself.

1846
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:23,060
没关系
It's all right.

1847
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:25,190
只是感叹
It's just that...

1848
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:31,020
这世上的美好数不胜数
It's wonderful. It's so many things.

1849
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:32,510
是啊
Yeah.

1850
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:35,610
我懂你的意思
I know what you mean.

1851

我喜欢你的...
I like your...

1852
