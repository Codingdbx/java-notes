18
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,310
Some days, my childhood feels so very far away.

19
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,840
And others,

20
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,800
I can almost see it.

21
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,770
The magical land of my youth,

22
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,110
like a beautiful dream

23
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,220
of when the whole world felt like a promise

24
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,860
and the lessons that lay ahead yet unseen.

25
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,200
Looking back, I wish I'd listened.

26
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,010
Wish I'd watched more closely

27
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,490
and understood.

28
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,290
But sometimes you can't see what you're learning

29
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,550
until you come out the other side.

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,320
Come on!

31
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,890
Come on!

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,970
Come on!

33
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,420
I'm gonna miss out.

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,290
I've seen this contest

35
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,700
humble even the most seasoned warriors, Diana.

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,810
I can do it.

37
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,860
Just do your best.

38
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,960
And remember,

39
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,360
greatness is not what you think.

40
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,670
Pace yourself and watch.

41
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,290
No!

42
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,530
No! That's not fair!

43
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,420
No.

44
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,510
No. But...

45
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,010
- You took the short path. - But...

46
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,480
- You cheated, Diana. - No. But that...

47
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,540
That is the truth.

48
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,150
That is the only truth, and truth is all there is.

49
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,060
But I would've won, if you didn't...

50
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,270
But you didn't.

51
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,010
You cannot be the winner, because you are not ready to win,

52
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,320
and there is no shame in that.

53
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,120
Only in knowing the truth in your heart

54
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,750
and not accepting it.

55
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,890
No true hero is born from lies.

56
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,760
Your time will come, Diana.

57
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,590
When?

58
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,250
When you're ready.

59
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,010
Look to the Golden Warrior Asteria.

60
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,170
She did not become a legend out of haste.

61
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,820
She did it through true acts of bravery.

62
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,420
Like patience, diligence,

63
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,440
and the courage to face the truth.

64
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,100
One day, you'll become all that you dream of and more,

65
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,490
and everything will be different.

66
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,140
This world is not yet ready for all that you will do.

68
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,360
Welcome to the future.

69
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,350
Life is good, but it can be better.

70
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,040
And why shouldn't it be?

71
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,800
Everything we've ever dreamed about is right at our fingertips.

72
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,260
But are you reaping the rewards?

73
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,550
Do you...

74
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,440
have it all?

76
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,300
- Slow down, dude. - No way.

77
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,660
Dude!

78
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,310
Welcome to Black Gold Cooperative.

79
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,100
- Oh, my gosh. Guys! - The first oil company

80
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,330
run for the people, by the people.

81
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,250
Think about finally having everything you've always wished for.

82
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,130
Let's go!

83
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,220
For a low monthly fee,

84
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,070
you can own a piece of the most lucrative industry in the world.

85
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,320
And every time we strike gold,

86
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,850
you strike gold.

87
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,970
No matter who you are, no matter what you do,

88
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,930
you deserve to have it all.

89
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,790
Do you have everything you've ever wanted?

90
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,880
Aren't you tired of always wishing you had more?

91
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,330
- Hey, move it. It's my turn. - Join me today.

92
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,290
- Yes! - Operators are standing by.

93
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,950
You don't need a pile of money or

94
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,630
some business degree to get started.

95
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,730
You don't even have to work hard for it.

96
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,530
- Good morning. - Good morning.

97
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,780
Don't even think about it.

98
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,610
At Black Gold Cooperative, all you need

99
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,330
is to want it!

101
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,890
We get what we want, and we go.

102
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,750
- What do you want? - None of this junk.

103
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,150
Word is on the street you got a nice little black market

104
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,960
side business going on back there.

105
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,980
If you don't tell, we won't tell.

106
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,030
Yes, yes, yes!

107
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,830
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

108
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,040
Yes, yes, yes!

109
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,810
Sir, are you all right?

110
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,700
Gun!

111
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,290
He's got a gun!

112
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,340
Shut up! Please!

113
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,590
Come on, dude. Can't hide. Let's get out of here!

114
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,770
Stop! Mall Security!

115
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,820
No, no, you, you, right there!

116
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,990
Right there! Freeze. Stop!

117
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,820
Move, move, move!

118
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,670
Chief, they're running up the escalator.

119
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,990
Stop! Freeze!

120
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,350
Freeze!

121
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,380
No!

122
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,470
We have several armed assailants running free.

123
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,390
We need the police here, right now.

124
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,810
Freeze!

125
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,360
Freeze! Freeze!

126
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,750
No. Dude, dude, calm...

127
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,260
Get back, man. I'll do it!

128
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,590
Hey, what are you doing?

129
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,930
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

130
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,060
What are you doing?

131
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,950
Hey, what are you doing?

132
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,880
- I'm not going back! - No, no, no!

133
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,400
Just chill out. Just chill.

134
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,920
- Stand back! - Don't do it!

135
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,940
Put the kid back.

136
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,270
Listen to me.

137
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,540
Listen to me!

138
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,780
- No! - What are you doing?

139
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,090
Pull her back. Pull her back in!

140
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,150
I'm not going back!

141
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,530
No!

142
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,480
Gonna let her go!

143
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,530
- No, no, no! - No, no!

144
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,900
What? Who? What?

145
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,970
We won't be doing that today.

146
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
We... We... We should go...

147
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,850
Oh, my gosh!

148
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
Hold tight.

149
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,430
I hate guns.

150
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,250
We've got to go now. Come on.

151
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,310
I'm sorry, lady.

152
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,830
I'm sorry. Okay?

153
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,380
It was his idea.

154
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,800
And the authorities still have questions.

155
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,680
In fact, the first is a real doozy, which is,

156
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,800
who exactly even stopped this crime?

157
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,050
If the story around here is to be believed,

158
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,960
it wasn't the police,

159
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,970
but a mysterious female savior

160
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,960
that multiple witnesses saw.

161
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,590
If this sounds familiar, it should.

162
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,590
We've now had more than a half-dozen similar sightings

163
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,750
across the greater D.C. area in the last year.

164
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,680
Which, of course, begs the biggest question of today,

165
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,390
who is this woman

166
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,800
and where did she come from?

170
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,860
Excuse me. Are you waiting for someone?

171
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,690
No. Just me.

172
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,140
Taxi!

173
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,150
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

174
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,790
Hey, we could share, if you like?

175
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,160
No, thanks. I'll wait.

176
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,560
Oh, my.

177
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,340
Hey, Jake.

178
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,120
Jake, hi. Can you...

179
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,900
I know, walk much? The latch of my...

180
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,840
Good morning.

181
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,160
Hi. Thank you.

182
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,080
Diana Prince, cultural anthropology and archaeology.

183
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,750
Barbara Minerva. Geology, gemology, lithology,

184
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,610
and part-time cryptozoologist.

185
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,140
I kept busy in college.

186
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,100
Sorry. It's these heels, you know. It's stupid.

187
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,260
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.

188
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,420
Scientists don't wear heels.

189
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,440
Sometimes we do.

190
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,330
- Right. Those are cool! - Have a nice day.

191
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,240
I like those.

192
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,650
Animal print.

193
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,330
Do you want to get lunch?

194
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,970
I, uh...

195
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,660
Not now, obviously.

196
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,180
It's morning. But later today, or whenever.

197
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,090
Like, around... Like, at lunchtime?

198
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,250
I have a lot of work today.

199
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,910
But maybe some other time?

200
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,990
- Yeah, I'm busy today, too. - Great.

201
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,380
Diana, do you happen to know who a Barbara Minerva is?

202
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,920
Oh, hi, Carol. Hi.

203
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,110
It's me. I'm Barbara. Remember? You hired me.

204
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,750
Started last week.

205
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,760
Gemologist?

206
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,490
Yes. And zoologist.

207
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,500
- We had a couple interviews. - Yeah.

208
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,750
Well, the FBI are gonna drop off

209
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,300
some artifacts later this afternoon.

210
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,350
The FBI?

211
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,530
- Yeah. - They're coming here?

212
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,780
The mall heist yesterday,

213
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,210
apparently they were using a jewelry store as a front.

214
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,620
Front for what?

215
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,800
Black market. Stolen jewels and art meant for private buyers.

216
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,120
But we could use your help identifying one in particular.

217
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,230
My help? Yeah, I'll help the FBI

218
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,050
- with whatever they need. - Is that a yes?

219
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,380
Yes. I would, um...

220
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,400
- I would love to assist you. - Wonderful.

221
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,690
It's nice to meet you.

222
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,890
We've met.

223
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,540
Have a nice day.

224
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,260
Bye, Diana.

225
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,780
Okay, item number 23.

226
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,470
Shoot. That's not it.

227
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,290
The Empress of Siam.

228
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,300
Originally found in the wreck of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha.

229
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,060
Sorry. I couldn't resist coming to see.

230
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,200
Oh, it's okay.

231
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,120
Here it is.

232
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,490
What is it?

233
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,460
I can't tell.

234
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,670
Some light.

235
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,620
I think the technical term here

236
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,330
is "extremely lame."

237
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,660
It's... It's citrine.

238
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,350
A classic stone used in fakes throughout history.

239
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,090
I can't imagine this is worth any more than $75.

240
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,120
What do you think?

241
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,180
Fakes aren't my forte, but let me see.

242
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,590
Latin.

243
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,280
At least it's an antique, right?

244
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,610
Or a purchase from a stall on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

245
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,010
You never know.

246
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,120
"Place upon the object held but one great wish."

247
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,530
You read Latin?

248
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,670
Yeah. Yeah. Languages are a hobby.

249
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,520
So maybe it's, like, a lucky charm or something?

250
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,650
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,680
Strange.

252
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,380
I really wish I had a coffee.

253
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,010
You're funny.

254
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,730
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's out sick.

255
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,910
Does anybody want this?

256
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,980
What? Yeah, I'll take one.

257
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,160
Ooh, hot! Hot, hot!

258
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,310
Did you see that?

259
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,020
Can you imagine?

260
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,480
If only.

261
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,720
So many things, I don't even know what I would wish for.

262
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,430
I do.

263
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,330
Well, um, anyway, sorry to bother you.

264
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,350
If you need anything, I'm around.

265
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,490
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

266
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,730
But thank you for...

267
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,870
That's okay. It's my job.

268
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,110
And I'll look into it more when I have a chance.

269
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,820
Okay.

270
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,690
Well, thanks for...

271
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,950
talking to me.

272
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,310
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

273
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,600
I mean, I'm fine.

274
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,130
You know, we could go and grab early dinner

275
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,120
and talk about exactly how lame that stone is.

276
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,570
Really?

277
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,540
Yeah, I mean, citrine?

278
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,670
Who are they kidding, right?

279
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,310
- So lame. - Dorky.

280
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,560
- Lame. - Yeah, let's go.

281
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,270
That's, like, the lamest of lames.

282
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,050
You're so funny.

283
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,980
Thank you.

284
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,380
I mean, no one's made me laugh like this in such a long time.

285
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,270
I mean, it's true, I don't get out much socially.

286
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,170
- You don't get out much? - No, not really.

287
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,970
- No. - I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

288
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,730
Because you just seem like the kind of person

289
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,450
who's, like, always out.

290
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,780
Like, people are asking you to go out all the time

291
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,120
and you live out. You're just out.

292
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,050
Like, you never get in.

293
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,950
You just seem like you'd be really popular.

294
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,680
And I would know because I've never been popular.

295
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
You haven't?

296
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,320
You're so personable.

297
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,940
So... free.

298
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,180
I mean, honestly, I gotta say that I envy that.

299
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,990
What?

300
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,570
You envy me? That doesn't make any sense.

301
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,220
Oh, my gosh.

302
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,640
People think I'm weird.

303
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,210
They avoid me and talk behind my back

304
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,450
when they don't think I can hear them.

305
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,610
I'm like, "Guys, I can hear you."

306
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,180
Barbara, my life

307
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,670
hasn't been what you probably think it has.

308
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,280
We all have our struggles.

309
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,160
Yeah, we do.

310
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,140
Have you ever been in love?

311
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,020
Yeah.

312
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,820
A long, long time ago.

313
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,370
You?

314
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,940
So many times, yeah. All the time.

315
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
Often.

316
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,760
So what happened?

317
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,420
Where'd he go, your guy?

318
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,440
He, uh...

319
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,450
He died.

320
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,490
But I still think sometimes that I see him up there in the sky.

321
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,430
He was a pilot.

322
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,350
He was all kinds of things,

323
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,520
but he was great. It was true.

324
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,890
I get it.

325
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,810
Well, cheers to us.

326
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,900
Wishing us better luck, I guess.

327
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,750
Hey, Leon.

328
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,710
Hey there, Barbara. Late night?

329
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,210
Yeah. Going back to work.

330
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,640
I wanted to bring this to you while it was still hot.

331
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,480
- You're too good to me. - It's not a problem.

332
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,410
Stay warm.

333
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Hey there, sweetheart. You need some help?

334
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,520
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

335
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,360
'Cause, uh,

336
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,300
you know, you look as though you're having

337
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,360
a little bit of trouble walking in those heels, huh?

338
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,440
It's okay. I wear these heels all the time.

339
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,880
Hey, come on. Let me walk you home.

340
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,910
- I'm not going home. - Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.

341
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,340
Come on.

342
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,480
What are you doing?

343
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,150
Let go of me!

344
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,390
- I'm just trying to help you! - Let go of me! Let go of me!

345
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,220
Let go!

346
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,430
Forgot my keys. Lucky.

347
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,670
- How did you... - Simple self-defense.

348
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,920
Used his own momentum against him. I'll teach you.

349
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,250
Honestly, it takes no power at all.

350
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,540
Are you okay?

351
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,610
- Yeah. Yeah. - Alright.

352
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,650
- Thank you. - Of course.

353
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,570
- Go home, okay? - Yeah.

354
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,500
Good night.

355
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,060
I do know what I'd wish for.

356
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,360
To be like Diana.

357
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,150
Strong, sexy,

358
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,480
cool.

359
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,690
Special.

360
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,600
Oh, no!

361
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,180
Sorry.

362
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,400
Oh, it's okay.

363
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,580
Barbara, thank God you're good in heels.

364
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,560
- Hey, Barbara. - Hi, Jake.

365
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,670
Looking good.

366
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,140
Thanks.

367
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,730
This is our Earth Sciences lab.

368
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,650
Oh, Barbara!

369
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,860
Hi.

370
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,150
Perfect.

371
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,980
I have someone I would like you to meet.

372
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,500
A pleasure, Ms. Minerva.

373
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,000
It's "Doctor," actually.

374
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,620
Have we met before? You look familiar.

375
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,030
- Do the thing. Do the thing. - No.

376
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,340
Life is good, but it can be better.

377
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,100
Oh, my gosh. From TV.

378
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh, my gosh. You're the oil guy.

379
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,430
- "The oil guy." I'll take it. - That's right.

380
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,390
Mr. Lord is considering

381
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,400
becoming a Friend of the Smithsonian at the Partner level.

382
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,850
Which entitles him to a handful

383
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,420
of private tours of our facilities,

384
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,070
and he asked for you by name.

385
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,460
- Me? - Well, what can I say, Doctor?

386
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,500
Your reputation precedes you.

387
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,090
And apparently we share a passion for gemology.

388
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,930
- Okay. We do. - I'll leave you to it.

389
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,820
Oh, let me just drop this off in my office, and we'll go.

390
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,650
Oh, gosh. Don't look in there. It's such a mess.

391
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,060
So, I thought maybe we could start upstairs.

392
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,130
I love that ruby.

393
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,640
Oh, no. Be careful with that.

394
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,910
- What? - That's very...

395
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,730
Hey, have you seen my friend? Where'd he go?

396
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,600
- I'm right here. - You are.

397
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,910
Thank God.

398
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,510
Oh, wait. You've got a little dust on you.

399
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,160
- Sorry. - Hey, good morning.

400
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,610
This is the one and only,

401
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,490
Mr. Maxwell Lord.

402
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,860
It's him.

403
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,210
Life is good,

404
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,640
but it can be better.

405
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,820
He's from TV.

406
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,710
I don't have a TV.

407
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,520
Well, I have a great relationship with Sears.

408
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,750
I can get you a brand-new TV by the end of the day.

409
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,080
Nineteen inches.

410
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,840
- No strings attached. - I'll stick to the one I don't have.

411
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,960
But thank you.

412
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,350
- Okay. - You're so generous.

413
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,340
Headline...

414
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,790
Mr. Lord

415
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,840
took a tour of the entire Smithsonian

416
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,900
while considering partnership,

417
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,520
and guess what he decided to do?

418
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,420
Give his entire donation to our department.

419
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,300
He's announcing it at tonight's Members' Gala.

420
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,970
It's going to be an amazing party.

421
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,740
I hope you have something nice to wear.

422
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,710
I actually tend to skip these events.

423
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,290
I find that our benefactors with a true eye towards philanthropy

424
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,220
prefer to stay out of the spotlight.

425
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,870
To let the museum's work garner the attention.

426
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,920
I agree.

427
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,390
Except,

428
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,650
I like to party.

429
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,770
Oh, my gosh. You're such a good dancer.

430
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,280
- You like Latin dancing? - I love it.

431
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,950
I know that I'm a terrible dancer.

432
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,580
No, I doubt that you're a terrible dancer...

433
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,240
- No, I've got a hip injury from high school. - ...the shape that you're in.

434
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,540
Great, so,

435
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,720
thank you so much for coming.

436
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,660
You know, I really should be going.

437
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,880
Thank you for the tour.

438
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,420
I will have to see you tonight.

439
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,530
See you tonight.

440
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,150
Bye. Have a good day.

441
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,290
I'll find you.

442
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,110
What?

443
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,310
I like him.

444
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,750
Thank you, John.

445
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,790
Ladies.

446
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,650
Mr. Lord.

447
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,550
Mr. Lord.

448
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,430
Not now, Raquel. My supplements?

449
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,920
On your desk, but Mr. Lord.

450
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,040
Mr. Lord.

451
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,620
Mr. Lord.

456
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,290
Mr. Lord.

457
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,060
Mr. Lord.

458
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,630
Dad!

459
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,650
How?

460
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,160
How!

461
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,480
It's your weekend.

462
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,690
Yes, clearly.

463
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,220
Alistair.

464
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,180
Where's the pool, Daddy?

465
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,470
It's not done yet, buddy.

466
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,030
But it doesn't matter.

467
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,790
You just have to be patient.

468
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,720
I told you the pool,

469
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,420
the helicopter,

470
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,340
you'll have it all. But remember,

471
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,290
Rome wasn't built in a day, was it? No.

472
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,650
Hasn't it been a lot of days?

473
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,460
Well, it takes time to become a great, great, number-one man,

474
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,980
like your dad is going to be.

475
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,490
Are you lying to your son, like you lie to everyone else?

476
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,030
Simon.

477
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,010
These offices aren't ready for guests yet.

478
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,610
It's over, Max.

479
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,580
I don't want to hear it anymore. I'm out.

480
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,280
Alistair, go wait with Raquel.

481
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,620
Simon.

482
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,920
I know it's hard to see right now, but

483
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,850
we are finally right

484
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,340
at the edge of turning this thing around.

485
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,100
"Turning it around"?

486
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,600
There is no oil. There never was.

487
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,040
So how are you gonna turn it around?

488
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,510
Get more sucker investors, like me?

489
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,360
- It's called a Ponzi scheme. - No!

490
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,830
I have a big...

491
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,820
There's something in the works.

492
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,870
And it's no scheme.

493
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,700
Simon, we have millions of acres of potentially oil-rich land.

494
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,030
You have oil rights on land

495
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,260
that everyone else passed on already.

496
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,440
Now, it didn't take much digging to find that out.

497
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,960
I should have done some digging on you, too,

498
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,380
Maxwell Lorenzano.

499
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,680
Didn't take long to find out you're nothing

500
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,390
but a lowlife con man.

501
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,180
I am not a con man!

502
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,380
I am a television personality.

503
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,600
And a respected businessman

504
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,170
- with a plan. - Come on.

505
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,640
With... With... With a great plan.

506
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,380
"If you can dream it, you can have it."

507
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,080
Something like that?

508
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,500
You have 48 hours

509
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,890
- to get my money... - You're going to regret this.

510
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,720
...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.

511
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,930
- Loser. - Simon, wait.

512
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,210
Simon, wait.

513
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,880
I am not a loser.

514
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,130
He's a loser!

515
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,310
And don't you ever believe a word that man said.

516
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,570
He's a liar...

517
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,050
and he's wrong.

518
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,480
And he will rue the day he walked away from me.

519
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,850
And you...

520
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,880
You are going to be so proud to be my son.

521
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,650
Okay.

522
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,150
You'll see.

523
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,510
Everyone will.

527
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,530
These are known for a terrific fit.

528
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,520
Yeah, I'm just not so great with heels.

529
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,170
Just try them.

530
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,170
Come out and show me.

531
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,800
Okay.

532
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,840
They do fit well.

533
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,220
Yeah, I like it.

534
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,800
You look amazing.

535
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,870
Do you think it's too tight?

536
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,800
I think it's just right.

537
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,820
I'll take it.

538
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,290
Hey there. How are you doing?

539
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,690
- Those shoes are incredible. - Thank you.

540
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,210
- What a beautiful dress. - You look fantastic.

541
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,640
Thank you so much.

542
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,590
Dr. Minerva.

543
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,480
You look breathtaking.

544
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,270
Thank you.

545
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,070
I... You know, we have to

546
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,290
go to these sort of things for work a lot,

547
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,090
so I've probably worn this dress a million times.

548
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,210
Actually, no. I...

549
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,470
I just bought this today.

550
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,370
I never look like this. Um, not even close.

551
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,800
Took me a long time to get ready.

552
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,010
Biotin.

553
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,220
You should try it.

554
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,930
Makes you glow like a teenager.

555
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:50,970
Reverses the clock.

556
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:54,270
Never accept the limitations of nature.

557
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,770
Yeah, no.

558
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,230
Especially not a beautiful woman like you.

559
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,680
God, it's so loud in here.

560
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,110
Yeah.

561
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,790
Can we go somewhere?

562
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,280
- Just me and you? - Yes.

563
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,960
Your office?

564
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,090
Look at all of this stuff. It's so...

565
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,930
It's so beautiful.

566
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,850
Like you.

567
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,430
What is that?

568
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,350
It's nothing special, really.

569
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,450
But the FBI did ask me to help them identify it.

570
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,480
Though it certainly has me stumped so far.

571
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:57,780
Let me help you.

572
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,650
Max is here. No need to be stumped ever again.

573
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,740
I have a dear friend in Roman antiquities.

574
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,610
- Roman antiquities. - Could give it a look, if you like?

575
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,800
It is Latin, isn't it?

576
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,100
I really shouldn't let it go out of the museum.

577
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,490
- Hey there, beautiful. - No, thank you. Excuse me.

578
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,750
Diana.

579
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,140
Hoping I'd see you.

580
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,150
Hey, do you know I'm at the White House now?

581
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,220
Yeah, that's right.

582
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,830
Interning, but requested by name, so...

583
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,900
Listen, I've had my eyes on you for some time.

584
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,840
- So if you ever need... - That's great, Carl.

585
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,990
Diana.

586
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,860
Diana.

587
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,040
Excuse me, I don't even know you, so please stop following me.

588
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,430
- Good night. - But...

589
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,000
I wish we had more time.

590
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,180
Why did you say that?

591
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,590
Don't say that to me.

592
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,310
You don't even know me.

593
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,750
Yes, I do.

594
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,020
I can save today...

595
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,250
but you can save the world.

596
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,400
Steve?

597
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,150
Diana.

598
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,090
But how?

599
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,810
I don't know.

600
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,960
Oh, my God.

601
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,150
It's you.

602
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,840
I missed you.

603
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,430
So what do you remember?

604
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,940
I remember...

605
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,920
I remember taking the plane up...

606
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,050
and then...

607
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,040
nothing, really.

608
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,500
Nothing.

609
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,460
But somehow, I know I've been someplace since then.

610
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,960
Someplace that's, uh...

611
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,390
I can't really put words to it.

612
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,530
But it's... It's good.

613
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,480
And then I, uh... I woke up here.

614
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,440
Where?

615
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,830
I ended up in a bed.

616
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:17,500
Strange, strange pillow bed with slats.

617
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,230
- A futon, yeah. - A futon?

618
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,570
- Yeah. - Yeah.

619
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:25,660
Well, not comfortable. And really a bit backwards

620
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,890
if I'm being really honest with you.

621
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:30,430
I mean, for a futuristic time like this. Nineteen...

622
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,290
Eighty-four. 1984.

623
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,190
That's amazing.

624
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,440
Would you like to see my futon?

625
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,880
Yeah. Um...

626
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,820
You don't have to tell me.

627
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,570
The place is a mess.

628
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,130
Cheese on demand.

629
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,460
I spent all morning cleaning his bedroom, but

630
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,530
he seems to me to be an engineer.

631
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,440
Lots of pictures of himself.

632
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,750
Not what I would do, but to each his own.

633
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,110
So this is how you found me.

634
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,220
Yeah, the phone book.

635
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,730
I guess some things are just future-proof.

636
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,430
So you went to my apartment?

637
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,920
Yeah, I tried to use the bike at first.

638
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,880
I couldn't really figure out how to get it going,

639
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,170
so I ran over and saw you come back.

640
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:03,230
And I was stunned.

641
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,510
There you were.

642
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,690
So I just, uh...

643
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,930
followed you, like a creep.

644
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,110
Diana, look at you. It's...

645
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,980
It's like not one day has passed.

646
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,740
I can't say the same thing about you.

647
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,960
Right, right, right. Right.

648
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,840
Yeah, he's, uh...

649
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,030
He's got it.

650
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,660
No, I like him.

651
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:17,720
He's great, but all I see is you.

652
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,120
"One great wish." I've been waiting.

653
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,580
I wish to be you.

654
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,310
The Dreamstone itself.

655
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,020
Come here.

656
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,910
- Good morning. - Good morning.

657
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,880
Been eating Pop-Tarts all morning,

658
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,650
and I've had about three, three pots of coffee.

659
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:11,410
This place is amazing.

660
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,480
- This place? - Yeah.

661
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,790
You know, if I really think about it,

662
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,950
I don't think I've ever been in a room more amazing.

663
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,750
- It's true. - Yeah.

664
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,080
This room is the most amazing place I've ever been in, in my entire life.

665
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,770
It is the most amazing place, right?

666
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,380
So let's, let's stay. We shouldn't go.

667
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,750
- I really don't want to. - So, let's not.

668
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,000
- Okay. - Okay.

669
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,770
Let's just stay here.

670
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,040
Let's just stay here.

671
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,380
Forever.

672
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,710
Although...

673
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,110
I should probably go and figure out

674
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,460
how a stone brought my boyfriend back

675
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,470
in someone else's body.

676
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,600
That's a fair point. Let's go.

677
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,540
Mr. Stagg?

678
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,880
Thank you, Belinda.

679
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,540
Oh, God.

680
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,030
You'd better be here with my money.

681
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,900
I'll have your money, Simon. Today, I'm here for an apology.

682
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,600
Are you out of your mind? I'm not going to apologize.

683
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,720
I'm sorry.

684
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,700
I messed up. I messed up. I lied.

685
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,030
And I'm sorry.

686
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,980
You know, the truth is, i knew we were going to sink a long time ago.

687
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,060
The wells were coming up dry.

688
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,100
And no data suggested that was going to change.

689
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,270
I should have folded then.

690
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,420
But all the people that bought in, that believed in me.

691
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,230
- I wanted to do right. - Oh, come on.

692
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,920
Max, look, you don't have to...

693
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,150
Simon, don't you understand that I wished for better?

694
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,230
That with every ounce of my being,

695
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,900
I wished that Black Gold would change the world for all of us.

696
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,970
And I know you wished that, too.

697
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,820
Of course I wished that, too.

698
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,670
Then your wish is granted.

699
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,400
And in return, I'll take all of your shares...

700
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,980
and full control of Black Gold,

701
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,810
after you are somehow magically removed from my path...

702
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,990
- You're gonna what? - ...forever.

703
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,610
Max!

704
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,820
Hey, Max!

705
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,020
Get back here! Max!

706
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,920
What the hell is going on?

707
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,490
We have a warrant for Simon Stagg.

708
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,060
My word. Are we in danger?

709
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,770
No, sir. Federal taxation crime.

710
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,370
It doesn't concern you. Move along.

711
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:41,820
Send them through.

712
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,250
- Okay. Follow me. - Let's go, guys.

713
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,640
So you said a stone started all of this?

714
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,020
Yeah, that's what we need to go and find out.

715
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,050
I mean, it must have done something.

716
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:11,120
This is dynamite.

717
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:12,620
What do you think?

718
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,980
- Yeah. Yeah... - Huh? Right?

719
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,060
I saw a couple of magazine pictures. They roll these up.

720
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,970
I think we can do better.

721
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,880
Look at all the pockets in this. There are pockets here.

722
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,500
There are pockets all over the pant.

723
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,010
American issue bag, adjustable.

724
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:29,580
Parachute pants?

725
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,660
- Yeah. Uh... - Does everybody parachute now?

726
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,100
You know, I'm not so keen on this one.

727
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,880
I figure you are, but you know what, I'm ready to go.

728
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,730
- Right? - No.

729
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,710
- You're not even giving it a second. - It's not good.

730
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,630
"Too much" in a good way or a bad way? Right?

731
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,800
In a bad way.

732
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:51,810
Now that's great.

733
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,730
It's beautiful.

734
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,300
Yeah. I would absolutely never wear it.

735
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,050
- I feel like a pirate. - Steve.

736
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,550
Who would wear this?

737
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:01,860
Diana,

738
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,230
have you seen these shoes?

739
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:06,200
- Let's keep the shoes. - Let's keep the shoes. Yes!

740
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,640
- Let's keep the shoes. - Yes!

741
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,080
This is a special one, okay?

742
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,100
Let's do this together.

743
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,320
One foot after the other.

744
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,400
Now stay on this one.

745
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:28,790
Go to the middle.

746
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,950
No, Steve...

747
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,660
Steve, you're gonna fall.

748
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,850
I really thought I was gonna fall.

749
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,510
What's up?

750
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,250
This is break dance.

751
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,290
- Dancing? - Yeah.

752
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,980
Don't worry.

753
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,260
- It's fine. It's just a move. - Yeah?

754
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,260
It's nothing.

755
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,640
It's all art.

756
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,480
Yeah.

757
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,200
That's just a trash can.

758
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,980
It's just a trash can. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:57,570
Is that a plane?

760
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,870
Come on. I want to show you something.

761
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,310
This is incredible!

762
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,410
And every time we strike gold,

763
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,160
you strike gold.

764
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,340
Think about finally having everything you've always wished for.

766
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,250
Raquel?

767
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,460
Raquel?

768
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,090
Black Gold. Can you hold, please?

769
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:03,010
Black Gold. Yes. Hold, please.

770
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,220
- Raquel? - Hold, please.

771
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:06,640
The wells struck pay!

772
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,200
- Which ones? - All of them.

773
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,830
And the investors heard about it somehow.

774
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,030
They're calling to up their buys.

775
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,620
Their friends are calling to buy in.

776
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,620
New investors are calling out of thin air.

777
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,610
Hold on, please. I need more help.

778
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:18,610
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please? - I'll get you help.

779
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,010
Tell me again. You wish you had more help?

780
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,630
Yes, I wish I had more help.

781
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,090
There are just too many calls to take.

782
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,750
Hi.

783
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,010
I'm sorry to bother you.

784
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,390
I'm meant to be interviewing at an accounting firm.

785
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,130
You're hired!

786
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:34,920
Welcome aboard!

787
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,730
- Emerson. - Emerson!

788
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:38,270
Is this the employment office?

789
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,680
Yes! You're hired, too!

790
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,260
Mr. Lord, it's Wall Street Journal.

791
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,770
They want to interview you about company's sudden surge.

792
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,140
I'll take it in my office.

793
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,980
And bring me my vitamins.

794
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,690
So I did read about four books last night...

795
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,420
to try to get to the bottom of this.

796
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,900
And did find out, Roger, you were right.

797
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,320
This is from the Song Dynasty.

798
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:02,340
You were correct.

799
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,380
And also interesting,

800
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,410
I was looking at a couple of encyclopedias last night and you...

801
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:08,120
Thanks.

802
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:12,300
So funny, all this reading seems

803
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:14,460
to have cured my eyesight somehow.

804
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,120
Interesting fact which we...

805
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,510
Good morning.

806
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,050
This is Steve. He's my, um...

807
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,440
- Old friend. - Yeah.

808
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,850
Hi, old friend Steve.

809
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,490
I'm Barbara, Diana's new friend.

810
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,030
So what do you do?

811
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:30,770
I'm a pilot.

812
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,150
- Pilot? Isn't that... - Can I speak to you for a second?

813
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,060
Sure.

814
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,900
So, I just wanted to speak to you about that stone.

815
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,200
The citrine one.

816
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:44,990
Do you have it?

817
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,330
Long story, actually, about that.

818
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,330
Max Lord came by to visit yesterday.

819
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,540
Which was actually pretty great.

820
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,920
I'll tell you about it later.

821
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,460
I let him

822
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:00,810
borrow it.

823
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,310
What? Why?

824
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,310
Well, Diana,

825
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:04,650
he just gave us a huge amount of money.

826
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,800
It's not like he's a stranger or anything.

827
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,900
Plus he has a friend who's an expert, and I don't know...

828
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,570
What do you mean? How could you loan it?

829
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,030
It's not even ours to loan.

830
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,990
What are you getting on my case for?

831
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,450
I've got 15 things in my office more valuable than that stone.

832
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:19,610
Do you know where he took it?

833
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,320
No, I have no idea.

834
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:24,280
Then I'll tell you what we find out.

835
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,030
Let's go.

836
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,950
- I like your pants very much. - Oh, thanks.

837
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,200
Yeah. Call me.

838
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,910
Or not. Whatever.

839
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,120
But I'd be curious.

840
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,630
Call the Black Gold hotline.

841
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:45,760
Shares are not available in the building.

842
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,110
What are these people doing?

843
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,140
Whatever it is,

844
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,680
we're not getting in that way.

845
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,980
Diana. Diana, this way.

846
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,660
Have at it.

847
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,630
Strong lock.

848
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:40,560
Steve.

849
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:00,380
- It's so dusty. - Yeah.

850
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:02,840
It's like a bomb went off.

852
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,980
Whatever this is, he's been looking for it for a long time.

853
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,530
"Place upon the object held."

854
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:37,660
What is it?

855
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,960
The language of the Gods.

856
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,590
Which God wrote it, is the question.

857
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,050
- Thanks. Oh, yeah. - Yeah. It's okay.

858
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,690
I gotta go do something. Okay. I'll talk to you. All right?

859
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:54,600
- Hello? - Barbara, I need your help.

860
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,900
I need you to find out

861
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,560
exactly where that stone was found.

862
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,270
"Where" is what I need to know. You understand?

863
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:04,060
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

864
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,320
Thanks.

865
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,990
You look like you saw a ghost.

866
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,780
I did.

867
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,910
There were many Gods

868
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,720
and they did different things for different reasons.

869
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,920
One was making objects like this.

870
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,480
There are universal elements in this world,

871
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,940
and when they're imbued into something,

872
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:35,550
they can become very, very powerful.

873
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,810
Like my Lasso of Truth.

874
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,320
The truth is what powers it, not me.

875
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,560
The truth is bigger than all of us.

876
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:45,810
But what is this?

877
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,230
I don't know. Uh...

878
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52,530
Brought me back.

879
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:58,540
Love or hope...

880
01:05:59,260 --> 01:05:59,910
maybe?

881
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:01,960
Maybe.

882
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,720
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you

883
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,340
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

884
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:10,710
We need to find this guy.

885
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:21,770
Look at this.

886
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,020
If this date's right, he's going to Cairo.

887
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,190
Cairo?

889
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:31,070
Yeah. Growth opportunity, you know?

891
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,360
"King of Crude"?

892
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,780
How is this so fast?

893
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,120
You have a plane that can fly from here to Cairo in one shot?

894
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,430
That is amazing.

895
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,840
Yeah, but we can't get you on one

896
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,460
because you don't have a passport.

897
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:46,720
I don't want to get on one,

898
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,100
I want to fly one. I want to fly the plane.

899
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,460
I want to fly this plane.

900
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:52,510
Yeah?

901
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,240
Oh, my Betsy.

902
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,210
Hey, Steve, this way.

903
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,420
Yeah.

904
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,210
Look at these gams.

905
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,310
You wanna choose?

906
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,440
This one.

907
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:49,690
I like it.

908
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:01,990
Okay.

909
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:06,160
Okay.

910
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:10,790
No.

911
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,420
All right. Good, good.

912
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,220
Fuel, fuel, fuel.

913
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:18,970
Here we go. Engine.

914
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,390
Here goes nothing.

915
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,420
- Ken? - What?

916
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,870
There's an aircraft on the runway.

917
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:43,960
What do you mean, "There's an aircraft on the runway"?

918
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,800
Approach, this is Tower.

919
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,260
There's an unlisted aircraft on the runway.

920
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,160
Are you seeing this?

921
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,600
- Can you get us up there? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

922
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,180
I just have to pick up speed first,

923
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,340
and then I'll take off.

924
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:59,760
The way I fly, they will never find us.

925
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,270
- I forgot to tell you. - What?

926
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,700
Radar. I can't explain now,

927
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,020
but they'll see us anywhere, even in the dark.

928
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,310
Well, will they shoot at us?

929
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,020
- Well, shit, Diana. - Right.

930
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,370
Wait. Shh! I know.

931
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,330
I know. Focus.

932
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,200
Focus.

933
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,350
My father hid Themyscira from the world,

934
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:34,380
and I've been trying to learn how he did it.

935
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,340
Did what?

936
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,340
Made something invisible.

937
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:40,220
But in 50 years, I've only done it once.

938
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:41,860
Well, now's not a bad time to start trying.

939
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,820
- How long does it last? - I don't know.

940
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,390
It was just a coffee cup...

941
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,600
and I lost it.

942
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:15,680
Approach, the aircraft has vanished.

943
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,840
Do you have eyes on it?

944
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,780
An invisible jet.

945
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:11,600
What's that?

946
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,370
Oh, it's okay.

947
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:16,770
It's just fireworks.

948
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:20,150
The Fourth. Of course.

949
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,440
The Fourth of July?

951
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,120
I got an idea.

952
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,280
You know, it's the one thing.

953
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,260
The one thing that's always been you to me.

954
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:57,870
What?

955
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:58,910
Flight.

956
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:00,460
Your gift.

957
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,960
I'll never understand it.

958
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,590
Ah, it's...

959
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,770
It's so easy, really.

960
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:11,640
It's wind and air

961
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:16,150
and knowing how to ride it, how to catch it.

962
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:19,640
How to join with it.

963
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:24,860
Yeah. It's like anything, really.

964
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:51,170
Great, thanks.

965
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,430
Found the last one.

966
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:57,390
This should keep you busy for a while.

967
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,230
Anything else I can get you? Coffee?

968
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:03,850
Tea?

969
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:05,480
Me?

970
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:10,030
I don't need anything from you, and I'm done.

971
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,780
You're done?

972
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,660
You don't have to be mean about it.

973
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:24,790
Hey, babe. Where you going?

974
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,000
No, thanks.

975
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:31,670
Ooh, you're pretty.

976
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,430
Hey, slow down, sexy.

977
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,180
You talking to me?

978
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,190
Yep. I'm talking to you.

979
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,020
Why don't you just slow down a bit, huh?

980
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:48,940
Come on, girl.

981
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,280
I'd rather not. You know what I mean?

982
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,670
I'd rather not have anything to do with someone like you.

983
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,740
I'd rather you stop harassing people.

984
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,160
Like me.

985
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:04,960
Do you remember me?

986
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,710
Oh, yeah, yeah.

987
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,300
I remember. Where were we, huh?

988
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:16,970
No.

989
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:22,270
No.

990
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,110
No.

991
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,320
She's right.

992
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,030
It's not that hard.

993
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,700
Yeah, I think I get it now.

994
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,620
His body weight does do all the work.

995
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,800
So easy.

996
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:55,880
I think

997
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,590
I could do this...

998
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:01,260
all...

999
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:04,980
night...

1000
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,600
long!

1001
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:27,040
Barbara?

1002
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,380
What are you doing?

1003
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:36,970
Mind your business.

1004
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:46,470
Sir?

1005
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,290
Your fortune the last few days

1006
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:58,320
has been impressive, to say the least.

1007
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,700
But why come all this way to meet with me?

1008
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,490
To meet a peer.

1009
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:06,830
A peer?

1010
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,970
No, Mr. Lord. I only agreed to meet with you

1011
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:11,460
because I was curious.

1012
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:14,090
No one gets that lucky. How did you do it?

1013
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:19,840
On my journey to self-fulfillment...

1014
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:23,220
I lucked into a secret.

1015
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,850
The secret of the wish.

1016
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,150
So I wished for it.

1017
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,270
Or someone wished for it for me.

1018
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,730
Tell me what you wish for, Your Highness,

1019
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:37,690
and I will show you how it works.

1020
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,000
I wish for things one cannot attain.

1021
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,110
Like what?

1022
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,040
All of my land to be returned.

1023
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,950
My ancestral realm.

1024
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,960
The Bialyian Dynasty.

1025
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,710
And for all the heathens who dare trod upon it

1026
01:17:55,770 --> 01:18:00,130
to be kept out forever, so that its glory may be renewed.

1027
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,050
You wish for that?

1028
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,680
I wish for that deeply.

1029
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,310
Your wish is granted.

1030
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:16,060
And in return, I will take your oil.

1031
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,880
You truly delight me.

1032
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,410
You know so little.

1033
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,950
I sold my oil to the Saudis.

1034
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:32,080
You are a silly man.

1035
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,300
Then I will take your security team

1036
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:44,650
and leave you here with nothing to defend yourself

1037
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:46,850
against the wrath you most certainly will face.

1039
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:31,010
Stop! Stop the car!

1040
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,560
What are you doing?

1041
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,930
Stop what you're doing now! I'm telling you.

1042
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,230
I command you to stop!

1043
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,270
Stop!

1044
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:41,900
Stop! Stop!

1045
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:47,100
This unbelievable and unexplainable wall appears to

1046
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,990
somehow be the work of Emir Said Bin Abydos.

1047
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,010
The government is reporting old rulings have emerged

1048
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:55,580
acknowledging his claim to the land.

1049
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,010
You okay?

1050
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,640
I'm fine.

1051
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:11,930
You keep saying that, but...

1052
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:17,310
That was him!

1053
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,730
That was Max Lord.

1056
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,090
Get rid of them, please.

1057
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,430
I got this.

1058
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:27,050
What?

1059
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:29,800
Diana!

1060
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:45,270
The brakes still work.

1061
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:01,700
Max Lord,

1062
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:05,430
you're putting yourself and everyone else in grave danger.

1063
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:07,460
I need you to give me the stone.

1064
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,920
What happened to it?

1065
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,170
You're looking at it.

1066
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,810
Steve!

1067
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:12,940
Diana!

1068
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,210
So who's the next closest person with oil?

1071
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,520
Diana. Diana.

1072
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:40,400
My God. What's going on with you?

1073
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,380
A truly bizarre phenomenon

1074
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,550
- that is being called the Divine Wall. - What is happening?

1075
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,130
It's an unexplainable event

1076
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:51,220
that now sees Egypt's poorest communities

1077
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:54,260
entirely cut off from their only supply of fresh water.

1078
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:58,120
An already tense situation now escalating as the Soviet Union

1079
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,200
announces they will recognize the Emir's claim.

1080
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,530
- Oh, no. - The United States, a longtime ally of Egypt,

1081
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:08,030
has declared their intention to side with the government.

1082
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:10,580
Bedlam on the home front now as well

1083
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:11,740
as the shocking news that

1084
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:13,960
American businessman Max Lord

1085
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,810
has somehow come into possession

1086
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:18,480
of over half of the world's oil reserves.

1087
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,240
The instability in the oil community has resulted

1088
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,180
in a nationwide run on gas,

1089
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,650
and experts are girding themselves...

1090
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:26,510
Hello?

1091
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:27,880
Barbara, it's Diana.

1092
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,450
- Did you... - Yeah. Uh, well, sort of.

1093
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,120
I haven't figured out exactly what the stone is,

1094
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,200
but I've found historical images of it.

1095
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,070
From where?

1096
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:39,550
That's the weird thing.

1097
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:41,150
From everywhere.

1098
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:44,970
It first appeared in the Indus Valley almost 4,000 years ago.

1099
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:47,700
It popped up again in Carthage in 146 BC.

1100
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,620
Kush, 4 AD.

1101
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,670
Romulus, the last Emperor of Rome,

1102
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:54,830
he had it on him when he was assassinated in 476.

1103
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:58,750
The last record is in some previously unknown dead city

1104
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:00,150
near Dzibilchaltun.

1105
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,140
- The Mayans. - Yeah.

1106
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,430
Anyway, it just led me to a bunch of dead ends,

1107
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:08,000
and my last lead is not that promising.

1108
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,200
What's that?

1109
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,240
A flier I found.

1110
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,020
Grabbed it at the embassy.

1111
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:15,770
Some guy advertising to be a Mayan shaman.

1112
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,370
But he literally teaches a course

1113
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:19,650
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

1114
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:22,230
- And he knows about the stone? - So he says.

1115
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:24,430
I'm gonna go there in the morning.

1116
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:27,660
Okay, we'll meet you there. And thank you.

1117
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:32,260
What is it?

1118
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:36,220
The stone has traveled the world

1119
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:38,080
to seemingly random and different places,

1120
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,470
- but they all have one thing in common. - What?

1121
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:43,590
Their civilizations collapsed catastrophically.

1122
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,720
Without a trace as to why.

1123
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,040
You don't think the stone could have...

1124
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,600
Do you?

1125
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:51,980
I don't know what to think, Steve.

1126
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:55,080
I can only hope I'm wrong.

1128
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,240
Babajide?

1129
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:33,020
- That was fast. - Morning.

1130
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,430
Hello.

1131
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:39,640
One second.

1132
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:44,160
So you're a Mayan?

1133
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:47,050
What? I'm a citizen of the world.

1135
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,280
It says your name is Frank.

1136
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:51,370
Yeah. Most of what I know is a past-life thing.

1137
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,720
So that's a no.

1138
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,220
But to answer your question, yes.

1139
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,550
My great-great-grandfather

1140
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,160
left me this.

1141
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,500
I don't know everything about it, but I have been warned

1142
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:05,440
I'm better off that way.

1143
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,800
What I do know is, it destroyed our people

1144
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,410
in a matter of months.

1145
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,940
The few survivors, they buried the stone,

1146
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:16,320
never to be exhumed under any circumstances.

1147
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,840
- Can I see that? - Be my guest.

1148
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,410
What?

1149
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:36,900
What is it?

1150
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:41,840
Dechalafrea Ero.

1151
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:43,300
What's that?

1152
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,150
A very bad God.

1153
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:48,450
The God of Lies, Dolos, Mendacius,

1154
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:50,560
Duke of Deception. He's been called by many names.

1155
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,110
But if he's the one who empowered that stone,

1156
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:54,480
there has to be a trick.

1157
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,530
What do lies have to do with granting wishes?

1158
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:58,920
It seems more like a Dreamstone to me.

1159
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:01,700
Wishes with a trick.

1160
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:04,370
"The Monkey's Paw."

1162
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:06,530
Beware what you wish for.

1163
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:09,520
It grants your wish, but takes your most valued possession.

1164
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,280
Diana, your powers.

1165
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:15,190
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1166
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:17,220
What's more precious than what you wish for?

1167
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,340
How do we stop this?

1168
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,230
The legend said

1169
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:21,520
it can only be stopped by destroying the stone itself

1170
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,850
or give back what was given.

1171
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,490
My people couldn't do the first thing

1172
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:26,430
and refused to do the second.

1173
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,540
Now the culture's destroyed.

1174
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,200
Wiped from the face of the Earth.

1175
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,680
No one renounced their wish?

1176
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,250
But the stone is already destroyed.

1177
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,160
What? When?

1178
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,640
"You're looking at it."

1179
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:43,250
"You're looking at it." That's what Max Lord said to me.

1180
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:45,590
Maybe it's him.

1181
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:47,640
He's become it somehow.

1182
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,530
But how would that happen?

1183
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:51,640
I mean, if he wished for...

1184
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,390
No, that's crazy. No.

1185
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:04,620
If we destroy it,

1186
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:07,290
if we destroy him...

1187
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:09,610
all the wishes go back.

1188
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,520
What are you talking about? No.

1189
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,590
I'm not gonna be a part of that. No.

1190
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:15,610
Or if everyone renounces their wish.

1191
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:18,410
No, there has to be a better way.

1192
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:20,220
No.

1193
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,430
She's right.

1194
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,600
We don't know enough. We just don't know enough.

1195
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,780
But what we do know is that

1196
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,910
we need to stop him before he grants any more.

1197
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:33,650
Stopping him might not be enough, Diana.

1198
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,260
Wishes have been made.

1199
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:39,740
Barbara?

1200
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:42,580
Barbara?

1201
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,400
Like I want any of these people in the club anyway.

1202
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,710
Can we tell them they're not invited?

1203
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:55,730
No, sir.

1204
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:58,070
- The FCC said we couldn't... - Oh, the FCC.

1205
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:02,170
The BBB, the FBD.

1206
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:04,630
It's a conspiracy against my success.

1207
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:07,200
They're jealous. That's why. Who's next?

1208
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,590
- Who's next? - Well, everyone you asked for,

1209
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,860
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,

1210
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,790
that televangelist who stole your slot.

1211
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:16,710
And you have Alistair for the night.

1212
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:19,750
Alistair? Again? How many weekends do I have?

1213
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,620
What? What? When? Tonight?

1214
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,600
He's here already.

1215
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,430
His mom is with her boyfriend.

1216
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,820
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.

1217
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:41,090
And buy Alistair a pony.

1218
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:43,890
No! A race car. Get him a race car.

1219
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,350
Let's get to it, Lai.

1220
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,070
Tell me...

1221
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:52,090
what do you want?

1222
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,350
What do you wish for?

1223
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:58,720
Me? Truly?

1224
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,790
The Soviets have sided with Iran.

1225
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:06,650
Iraq is preparing to defend ourselves, as unrest spreads.

1226
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:08,700
And you need? What do you...

1227
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,470
What do you wish for?

1228
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,860
Consider the sex tape gone.

1229
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,150
And God darn it, if I have to keep doing this

1230
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,490
one by one, by one, by one...

1231
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:20,970
- How's your health? - Well...

1232
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:21,820
Forget that.

1233
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:23,940
But I will take your entire congregation

1234
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,500
and your time slot.

1235
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,740
Let me ask you,

1236
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:31,720
when they pray, is there any way I could get all of them to...

1237
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,640
join hands with me?

1238
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,330
And simply say, "I wish"

1239
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:37,210
rather than, "I pray"?

1240
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:39,020
Would that even work?

1241
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:39,860
I don't...

1242
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:44,540
I need to find a way to touch a lot of people at the same time.

1243
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:47,310
Sir. The police are here.

1244
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:49,390
They're challenging the jurisdiction of your security team.

1245
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:51,140
Oh, God!

1246
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:54,650
This isn't working. Bring in someone new.

1247
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:55,970
And my son.

1248
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:57,480
You, beat it.

1249
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,820
Alistair!

1250
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,210
I've missed you, buddy.

1251
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:15,940
Come. Sit down with Daddy. I'm sorry.

1252
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:18,640
But, your dad

1253
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:22,500
is on the absolute precipice of everything.

1254
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:24,940
Remember when I told you that I would be number one?

1255
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:27,160
Do you remember? Your dad?

1256
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,580
Well, I'm inches away.

1257
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,140
I know it's hard. I know.

1258
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:32,650
But listen,

1259
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:35,350
I also know what you wish for, and I wish for it, too.

1260
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,450
Do you hear that? I wish for it, too.

1261
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:38,720
I just wish I could be with you...

1262
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,860
No!

1263
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,870
You don't use your one wish like that, Alistair.

1264
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:47,780
You don't wish for something that you already have.

1265
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,650
You wish for greatness, for success.

1266
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:52,670
That's why I'm doing all of this.

1267
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:57,640
Don't you see that my greatness is your greatness?

1268
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,640
Then I wish for your greatness.

1269
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,060
No. No!

1270
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:19,290
Thank you.

1271
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,600
I love you so much.

1272
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,000
And I promise you, one day,

1273
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:27,170
everything is going to make sense.

1274
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:30,680
And one day, you'll thank me.

1275
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,800
But right now, I, uh...

1276
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:37,100
Right now, I need you to stay here with Emerson, okay?

1277
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:38,130
I'll be back.

1278
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:39,490
You stay here.

1279
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,710
You. You.

1280
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:53,840
Yes, sir?

1281
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,630
Don't you wish I had an audience with the President today?

1282
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:57,620
Of course I do.

1283
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:00,260
And can I tell you how happy I am that you value my opinion, sir?

1284
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:02,930
Wait a minute. Have I asked for your wish before?

1285
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:05,050
Yesterday. A Porsche.

1286
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:06,930
What is it with you aides and Porsches?

1287
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:08,220
You!

1288
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:11,130
This way.

1289
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:18,250
How's traffic?

1290
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:19,610
Terrible.

1291
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:20,930
Don't you wish it wasn't?

1292
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:24,080
And that everywhere you went parted like the great Red Sea?

1293
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:27,800
Of course I wish that. Sadly, ain't gonna happen.

1294
01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:37,850
Hey, you! Stop!

1295
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:40,410
Come on in. It's not safe.

1296
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:42,490
There's a riot at the Saudi Embassy

1297
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:45,010
and there are Porsches racing up and down the street.

1298
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:45,970
Come on. It's mad.

1299
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:48,470
But my cows.

1300
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:52,350
I told a man I wanted a farm.

1301
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,520
I didn't mean here.

1302
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,330
I'll be right back.

1304
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,240
Diana, I know it's been hard.

1305
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,280
- You don't know. You don't. - But we...

1306
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:08,650
It can't go on like this.

1307
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:10,770
- I can't talk about this. - We have to talk about it.

1308
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:13,140
Steve, I can't talk about this!

1309
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:20,770
I give everything I have, every day.

1310
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:22,290
And I'm happy to.

1311
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,710
But this one thing...

1312
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:30,190
You're all that I've wanted for so long.

1313
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,860
You're the only joy I've had or even asked for.

1314
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:37,360
I am so sorry...

1315
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,860
but that's crazy.

1316
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:45,750
There's a world out there full of

1317
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,400
so many better guys, for one.

1318
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,770
I mean, how about this guy? How about him?

1319
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:52,010
I don't want him. I want you.

1320
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:55,950
Why, for once, can't I just have this one thing, Steve?

1321
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,660
This one thing.

1322
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,590
I'm not sure we have a choice.

1323
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:06,930
Well, I do have a choice.

1324
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:09,340
And I can't give you up. I can't.

1325
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:11,610
So I won't. So we need to stop him

1326
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,280
so we can figure that out.

1327
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:15,660
There has to be another way.

1328
01:40:16,570 --> 01:40:17,870
Has to.

1329
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:36,590
This is incredible.

1330
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:42,880
What's that?

1331
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,450
From my culture.

1332
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:50,200
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior. One of our greatest.

1333
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,580
It's huge. This whole thing?

1334
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:56,400
What is it made out of?

1335
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,440
Here. Let me show you.

1336
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:00,710
Give me your hand.

1337
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,890
What are you talking about? I haven't lied.

1338
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,620
The Lasso does more than just make you tell the truth.

1339
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,580
It can make you see it, too.

1340
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:15,370
Her name was Asteria.

1341
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:17,450
She was our greatest warrior.

1342
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:21,870
When mankind enslaved the Amazons, my mother freed us.

1343
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,110
But someone had to stay behind to hold back the tide of men

1344
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:27,750
so the others could escape to Themyscira.

1345
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,290
My people gave up all of their armor

1346
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:34,450
to make her one suit strong enough to take on the whole world.

1347
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,660
And Asteria sacrificed herself for a better day for others.

1348
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:46,280
That's...

1349
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,380
That's incredible.

1350
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:52,480
When I came here, I searched for her.

1351
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:55,200
But all I could find was her armor.

1352
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,610
What is this?

1353
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,230
Where is he going?

1354
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:02,010
Oh, no.

1355
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,190
Diana, Diana! What are you doing?

1356
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:25,210
- Where are you going? - Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.

1357
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:26,980
No. No. Listen to me.

1358
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,750
You're getting weaker, Diana.

1359
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:29,970
- What if you fall? - I won't.

1360
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:31,750
You might. We don't know that.

1361
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,780
There has to be another way in.

1362
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,910
Everything okay, Mr. President?

1363
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,580
Yes.

1364
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:54,360
Something very strange. I...

1365
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:58,060
I thought I was somewhere else entirely. Suddenly...

1366
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:02,630
Anyway. Hectic times.

1367
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,070
Give us a minute.

1368
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,520
Excuse me.

1369
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,940
- Carl. - Diana.

1370
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,970
- Hi. - What a pleasure.

1371
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:21,890
Good to see you. How have you been?

1372
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:23,470
- Good. - This is Steve.

1373
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:26,540
Steve, this is Carl. My colleague.

1374
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,960
Shall we, uh...

1375
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,680
Yeah, we shall.

1376
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:33,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.

1377
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:35,440
In fact, I don't even know what we're supposed to discuss.

1378
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,780
Exactly that, Mr. President.

1379
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:40,550
These hectic days, hectic times.

1380
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:42,970
And you.

1381
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:46,160
These aren't exactly my favorite of the busts on display here,

1382
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:48,180
but it's a little picture of my top ten,

1383
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,060
maybe top five at a push.

1384
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,400
Oh, here's something up ahead that will interest you.

1385
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,970
These are floor tiles

1386
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:57,160
originally laid by none other than Jan Lincoln,

1387
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,220
a little-known descendent of Abraham.

1388
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:02,420
You're having some troubles?

1389
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,810
Everywhere suddenly.

1390
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:05,490
Cuba, Egypt,

1391
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:07,010
even here.

1392
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,350
But Russia...

1393
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,550
very troublesome.

1394
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:14,860
I appreciate your concern,

1395
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:16,950
but all the money in the world won't help us now.

1396
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:18,590
It's not money I'm offering.

1397
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:20,960
You.

1398
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,150
You are a man of faith,

1399
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:27,460
and I have been very blessed lately.

1400
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,830
I want to share my blessing with you.

1401
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,760
The power of positive thinking.

1402
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:41,950
Now...

1403
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:46,730
tell me, Mr. President, what do you need?

1404
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:49,430
And you're not speaking to me here, but to the universe.

1405
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,830
What do you wish for?

1406
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:57,130
What is there to wish for but more?

1407
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:59,660
More nuclear weapons. More than they have.

1408
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,170
Closer to 'em.

1409
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:03,420
If I just had that in place,

1410
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,500
then they would have to listen to us.

1411
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:09,340
A nice thought. And I grant you...

1412
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,560
Oh, my...

1413
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,580
And you know what I'd like?

1414
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:25,530
I would want all of your power, influence, authority.

1415
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:27,010
All the respect you command

1416
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:31,190
and the command everyone must respect.

1417
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,740
I mean, what else is there?

1418
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:43,110
Now, tell your people I would appreciate

1419
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:46,790
absolutely no interference whatsoever.

1420
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:49,260
No taxes, no rule of law, no limits.

1421
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:53,920
Treat me like a foreign nation with absolute autonomy.

1422
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,420
Very good, sir.

1423
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,050
Right away.

1424
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:05,950
What's this?

1425
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:07,680
Global Broadcast Satellite.

1426
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,390
Top-secret program that enables us

1427
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:11,710
to override any broadcast system in the world

1428
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:14,820
in case we need direct contact with the people of an enemy state.

1429
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,420
So what does that mean?

1430
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:18,700
You're taking over everyone's TVs?

1431
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:19,940
How?

1432
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,680
It uses particle beam technology,

1433
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,450
just like the Star Wars program.

1435
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:26,540
Apparently, it bathes the landscape in a signal of particles

1436
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:29,500
that goes in and fiddles with any technology it touches.

1437
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,870
New or old. Broadcast whatever you want.

1438
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:34,520
Very impressive.

1439
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:38,200
You said "touches"?

1440
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:41,430
As in the particles you are sending...

1441
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:49,590
are touching everything?

1442
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:50,700
It's a figure of speech,

1443
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:52,320
but yes.

1444
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,600
That's how it was explained to me.

1445
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,790
I need immediate access to this satellite.

1446
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:57,760
And a chopper to get me there.

1447
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,480
Yes, sir. Right away.

1448
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:12,300
Well, aren't you resourceful?

1449
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:15,370
Come with me before you do any more damage, Max.

1450
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:17,220
No. I don't think so.

1451
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,880
Remove this woman, please...

1452
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,290
permanently.

1453
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:31,750
- Are you okay? - I don't know.

1454
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,240
No, Steve. You can't use that.

1455
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,780
It's not their fault.

1456
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,260
That's neat.

1457
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:02,640
Barbara.

1458
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,900
I can't let you do this, Diana.

1459
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:41,780
Barbara. What...

1460
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,890
- How... - I can't let you stop Max.

1461
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:46,940
You're not the only one with something to lose.

1462
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:53,070
Turns out wishing to be like you...

1463
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:56,110
came with some surprises.

1464
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:00,430
Hands up.

1465
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:02,420
- Hands up. - Hands up, hands up.

1466
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,120
Hands up!

1467
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,590
- Hands up! - Now! Now, now!

1468
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,420
Open fire!

1469
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:38,570
Oh, how sweet, defending your love. Huh?

1470
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:41,200
What do you wish for? Do you wanna be a real boy?

1471
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,430
No.

1472
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,690
Just not to be handcuffed to you, but now I am.

1473
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:54,350
I just learned that.

1474
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:08,360
Barbara, stop!

1475
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,950
Listen.

1476
01:51:19,950 --> 01:51:21,360
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

1477
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,590
I'm not what you think.

1478
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:24,190
You can't possibly understand or handle...

1479
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:26,400
Oh, I can't possibly understand?

1480
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,040
Dumb little old me.

1481
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,510
Dumb little, poor little

1482
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,560
nothing, nobody me.

1483
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,450
I couldn't possibly handle it.

1484
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:41,040
No, Barbara. That's not what I'm saying.

1485
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:49,800
Well, I'm handling it beautifully.

1486
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,880
And I'm not giving it back!

1487
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:17,100
Go.

1488
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:18,890
Run!

1489
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:21,380
Everyone, stand down.

1490
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:23,180
Nobody hurts her.

1491
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,160
They couldn't if they tried.

1492
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:34,220
You've always had everything,

1493
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,860
while people like me have had nothing.

1494
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:41,840
Well, now it's my turn. And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

1495
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,100
But what is it costing you?

1496
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:46,790
What is it costing me?

1497
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:50,160
If it's the monkey's paw, it takes as much as it gives.

1498
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:54,840
Yes, you're strong, but...

1499
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:57,320
what did you lose, Barbara?

1500
01:52:58,390 --> 01:53:01,670
Where's your warmth, your joy,

1501
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:02,770
your humanity?

1502
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:07,080
You're attacking innocent men, Barbara. Look at yourself.

1503
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,600
Forget about me.

1504
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,470
What is it costing you?

1505
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:20,650
That's right.

1506
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:23,580
Get used to it.

1507
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:28,670
If you go after Max Lord...

1508
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:32,150
or hurt him in any way,

1509
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,850
I will destroy you.

1510
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:35,100
Barbara!

1511
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:53,800
Are you all right?

1512
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:55,330
Come here.

1513
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:17,230
Room for one more?

1514
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,720
Sir, you need to wait.

1515
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,690
- The President has a meeting right now. - We need to see the President.

1516
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:31,230
 He needs to be told.

1517
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:33,330
- This is a matter of life and death. - What is going on?

1518
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:36,690
The Soviets' early detection system picked up our new nukes.

1519
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:37,770
What new nukes?

1520
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:41,140
A hundred warheads just went online, ready to launch.

1521
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:43,260
They're taking this as an act of war.

1522
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:45,070
Prepping to return fire.

1523
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:46,970
Return? What?

1524
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:48,230
We haven't done anything.

1525
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:49,860
That's not how it looks.

1526
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:52,220
And we'd fire for less.

1527
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:56,860
Are you kidding me?

1528
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:59,570
You blew through that light right there! You didn't even see!

1529
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:00,800
How do you not see that?

1530
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,020
Riots across the world erupting

1531
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:06,510
as America and the Soviet Union end communication,

1532
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:08,100
declaring war!

1533
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:10,230
No one knows any more than that.

1534
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:12,670
But as you can imagine with what's at stake,

1535
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:16,450
there has been madness down here in downtown Washington, D.C.

1536
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:18,390
The national guard has been brought in...

1537
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:20,700
Attention! Attention!

1538
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:22,270
By executive order,

1539
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:24,830
all civilians must immediately evacuate

1540
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:26,930
the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor

1541
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:30,120
between 3rd and 12th streets northwest.

1542
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:41,630
It is the final days of tribulation that is happening to us now.

1544
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:45,460
Can you see what your sinfulness has done?

1545
01:55:45,690 --> 01:55:47,310
Your greed?

1546
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:50,250
You gotta do something! You gotta do something!

1547
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:55,380
Come on! This way! Come on!

1548
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,250
Riley!

1549
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:01,960
All units.

1550
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:03,390
Riley!

1551
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:04,830
We need help.

1552
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:08,400
- It's chaos out here. - Riley!

1553
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,090
What do you want me to do? I don't know what to do.

1554
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:13,750
Somebody help me.

1555
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,240
I don't know what to do.

1556
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,300
Diana.

1557
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,020
Diana, listen to me.

1558
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:33,370
I had a great life.

1559
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,420
Steve...

1560
01:56:35,470 --> 01:56:37,380
And you only made it better.

1561
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:41,780
But you know what you need to do.

1562
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,710
The world needs you.

1563
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:51,470
- All right? - No.

1564
01:57:06,230 --> 01:57:07,740
I'll never love again.

1565
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:09,400
I pray that isn't true.

1566
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:12,950
There's a wonderful, big world out there.

1567
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:16,000
This crazy new world.

1568
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:19,130
And I am so happy I got to see it...

1569
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:22,320
but it deserves you.

1570
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:34,620
I can't say goodbye.

1571
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,890
I can't say goodbye.

1572
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:40,020
You don't have to.

1573
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:46,230
I'm already gone.

1574
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:03,330
I'll always love you, Diana,

1575
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:05,000
no matter where I am.

1576
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:07,440
I love you.

1577
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,720
I renounce my wish.

1578
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:09,300
It's easy.

1579
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:14,240
It's only wind and air...

1580
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:17,830
and how to ride it.

1581
01:59:20,490 --> 01:59:21,530
How to catch it.

1582
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:36,900
You made a wish too, huh?

1583
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:42,790
They're a bitch, aren't they?

1584
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:44,880
Make you pay a price, but

1585
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,660
I've never been one for rules.

1586
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:49,230
Luckily, I have a way to reverse it.

1587
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,900
The answer is always more.

1588
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,650
But you only get one wish.

1589
02:00:54,650 --> 02:00:56,660
But I, my dear, grant the wishes.

1590
02:00:57,490 --> 02:01:00,410
So I take what I want in return.

1591
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:03,700
There's nothing in this world someone doesn't have.

1592
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:07,210
I'll rebuild my health, wish by wish, organ by organ...

1593
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:09,210
if I have to.

1594
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:12,210
I'll be invincible.

1595
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:14,930
Tell me,

1596
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,850
what do you want?

1597
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:19,600
I'm feeling generous.

1598
02:01:23,390 --> 02:01:27,520
I don't want to be like anyone anymore.

1599
02:01:29,450 --> 02:01:31,080
I want to be number one.

1600
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:36,340
An apex predator,

1601
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:39,720
like nothing there's ever been before.

1602
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:44,100
I like the way you think.

1603
02:01:45,970 --> 02:01:46,810
Go on.

1604
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,530
You heard we were coming, I presume?

1605
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:06,660
How many broadcasting signals can I take over at once?

1606
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:09,080
Well, as many as you like, sir.

1607
02:02:09,450 --> 02:02:10,830
I'll take all of them.

1608
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:11,870
All of them?

1609
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:17,000
And I sure wish this works for me. Don't you?

1610
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:18,550
Yes, sir.

1611
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:24,340
Lights, camera...

1612
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:28,220
Okay, stations 12, 9, 16, go transmit.

1613
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:31,100
I need it now. 16, 9, 12. Do you receive?

1614
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:32,390
Copy. Maximum power.

1615
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:33,480
Okay. Moving forward now.

1616
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:38,190
Global transmission in five, four, three, two...

1617
02:02:42,070 --> 02:02:43,530
Citizens of the world,

1618
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:47,490
allow me to introduce myself.

1619
02:02:48,910 --> 02:02:50,870
I am Max Lord,

1620
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,730
and I'm here to change your life.

1621
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:56,660
All you have to do...

1622
02:02:58,780 --> 02:03:00,240
is make a wish.

1623
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:03,950
Anything you want.

1624
02:03:04,910 --> 02:03:07,580
Anything you dream of, you can have it.

1625
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:10,000
If you can dream it...

1626
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:11,480
Daddy?

1627
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,520
...you can achieve it.

1628
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:16,560
So just look into my eyes...

1629
02:03:18,310 --> 02:03:19,730
and make a wish.

1630
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:25,210
Anything you dream of, have it.

1632
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:27,660
Right now.

1633
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:31,460
Do you want to be rich?

1634
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:35,790
Do you want to be powerful?

1635
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:37,040
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.

1636
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:38,620
- Say it out loud! - You know what I wish?

1637
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:40,460
- What? What? - I wish all you Irish bastards

1638
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:42,540
would get sent back to where you came from!

1639
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:44,630
Yeah? Well, I wish you'd drop dead!

1640
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:46,390
Look around you.

1641
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:49,010
Make your wish!

1642
02:03:50,010 --> 02:03:51,520
Take what's yours.

1643
02:03:51,970 --> 02:03:53,390
Whatever you want,

1644
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:55,310
you can have it.

1645
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:57,200
I wish for a million dollars.

1649
02:04:04,150 --> 02:04:05,450
Wish for it.

1650
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:18,710
Anything you want.

1651
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:23,130
Anything you dream of, have it.

1652
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:25,500
Yes.

1653
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:26,800
I can hear it.

1654
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:29,640
I hear you.

1655
02:04:30,390 --> 02:04:31,430
Yes, say it.

1656
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:32,890
Say it out loud.

1657
02:04:33,390 --> 02:04:35,680
That's right. "I wish."

1658
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:39,560
Take it. Take it. It's all yours.

1659
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:41,770
It's all yours for the taking!

1660
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:51,540
And I... I take your health and your strength.

1661
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:55,700
Give her your rage and your prowess.

1662
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:58,170
And I take your power.

1663
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:00,630
I take your life force.

1664
02:05:01,210 --> 02:05:02,040
Yes.

1665
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,160
Yes!

1666
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:08,530
That's right.

1667
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:11,580
You're doing great.

1668
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:19,310
It's all yours.

1669
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:20,980
I wish you were here, Daddy.

1670
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:22,840
I wish you'd come back. Daddy, please!

1671
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:26,050
- All you have to do is wish for it. - I'm still here, Daddy.

1672
02:05:26,050 --> 02:05:27,720
Daddy, please!

1673
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:42,850
Barbara.

1674
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,810
What did you do?

1675
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:35,300
No.

1676
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:38,550
You renounced your wish.

1677
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:41,140
I had to. And so do you.

1678
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:44,430
Nothing good is born from lies, Barbara.

1679
02:08:45,770 --> 02:08:47,520
We're wasting precious time.

1680
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:52,360
Even now, patronizing me.

1681
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:24,030
Barbara...

1682
02:10:24,030 --> 02:10:26,120
I know you're in there. Please.

1683
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,620
Please, renounce your wish.

1684
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:28,790
It's over.

1685
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:31,370
Please!

1686
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:32,960
Renounce your wish.

1687
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,120
Never!

1688
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:39,240
Then I'm so sorry.

1689
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:23,420
That's right.

1690
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:25,390
Just wish for it.

1691
02:11:25,630 --> 02:11:26,930
It's yours now.

1692
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:30,600
All you have to do is say it out loud.

1693
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:33,500
Make a wish. Any wish.

1694
02:11:33,930 --> 02:11:34,980
Look into my eyes,

1695
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:38,560
and everything you've been waiting for, it's all yours.

1696
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:39,780
You're too late.

1697
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:42,940
Granted.

1698
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:45,320
Granted.

1699
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,950
Granted!

1700
02:11:48,910 --> 02:11:50,030
Granted!

1701
02:11:50,910 --> 02:11:53,660
- Granted. - Why are you doing this?

1702
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:55,370
Don't you have enough?

1703
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:56,790
Why not more?

1704
02:11:57,330 --> 02:11:59,250
Why not wish for more?

1705
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:01,630
But they don't know what you're taking from them.

1706
02:12:01,630 --> 02:12:03,710
We want what we want.

1707
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:05,550
Just like you did.

1708
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:08,800
So make a wish.

1709
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:10,510
Very good.

1710
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,230
Granted.

1711
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:26,450
It's too late, Diana.

1712
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,240
They already heard me.

1713
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:31,950
Already wished!

1714
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:36,200
And those that haven't yet...

1715
02:12:41,290 --> 02:12:42,710
They will!

1716
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:57,690
Granted.

1717
02:12:58,810 --> 02:12:59,980
Granted.

1718
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,860
Granted.

1719
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:11,160
Poor Diana.

1720
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,060
Why be such a hero?

1721
02:13:15,830 --> 02:13:20,290
You could have kept your pilot and your powers,

1722
02:13:20,290 --> 02:13:23,240
if only you'd join me.

1723
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:25,650
Wanna reconsider?

1724
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:30,910
I'm a forgiving man!

1725
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:36,540
You want him back?

1726
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,140
Just say the word.

1727
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:41,900
You can have it all!

1728
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:45,980
You just have to want it!

1729
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:51,490
I've never wanted anything more.

1730
02:13:57,560 --> 02:13:59,110
But he's gone...

1731
02:14:00,830 --> 02:14:02,410
and that's the truth.

1732
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:06,110
And everything has a price.

1733
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:08,380
One I'm not willing to pay.

1734
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:09,880
Not anymore.

1735
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:21,670
This world was a beautiful place just as it was...

1736
02:14:23,380 --> 02:14:25,170
and you cannot have it all.

1737
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,880
You can only have the truth.

1738
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,110
And the truth is enough.

1739
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:35,450
The truth is beautiful.

1740
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:41,000
So look at this world...

1741
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:45,580
and look at what your wish is costing it.

1742
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,260
You must be the hero.

1743
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:53,430
Only you can save the day.

1744
02:14:55,930 --> 02:14:57,970
Renounce your wish

1745
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:00,890
if you want to save this world.

1746
02:15:00,890 --> 02:15:02,810
Why would I...

1747
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:06,610
when it's finally my turn?

1748
02:15:08,730 --> 02:15:12,070
The world belongs to me!

1749
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:16,490
You can't stop me. No one can!

1750
02:15:17,790 --> 02:15:19,700
I wasn't talking to you.

1751
02:15:27,670 --> 02:15:30,260
I was talking to everyone else.

1752
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:38,600
Because you're not the only one who has suffered.

1753
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:41,810
Who wants more.

1754
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:47,230
Who wants them back.

1755
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:52,740
Who doesn't want to be afraid anymore.

1756
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:57,830
Or alone.

1757
02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:59,670
Stop!

1758
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:02,490
Cut the signal! Stop!

1759
02:16:02,870 --> 02:16:04,410
Or frightened.

1760
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:06,620
Or powerless.

1761
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:09,330
'Cause you're not the only one

1762
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:14,330
who imagined a world where everything was different.

1763
02:16:19,090 --> 02:16:21,510
Better. Finally.

1764
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:30,270
A world where they were loved

1765
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:34,490
and seen, and appreciated.

1766
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:35,400
Finally.

1767
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:37,660
Oh, my God. Who is he?

1768
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:39,900
He doesn't even speak English.

1769
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:41,660
What is he eating?

1770
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:43,410
Look at his shoes!

1771
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:45,720
Weirdo!

1773
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:07,270
But what is it costing you?

1774
02:17:08,940 --> 02:17:10,650
Do you see the truth?

1775
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:24,910
Daddy!

1776
02:17:26,370 --> 02:17:27,560
Daddy!

1780
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:39,880
The Russians are launching.

1781
02:17:40,060 --> 02:17:41,720
We've got orders to counter.

1782
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:43,280
All right, all right.

1783
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:02,200
Alistair!

1784
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:05,770
Emergency alert.

1785
02:18:05,850 --> 02:18:08,580
You have four minutes to find shelter.

1786
02:18:13,170 --> 02:18:14,960
Alistair!

1787
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,340
My son!

1788
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:20,840
Stay calm and stay indoors.

1789
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:22,470
Alistair!

1790
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:25,300
Daddy! Daddy!

1791
02:18:25,470 --> 02:18:26,840
Help me, Daddy!

1792
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:29,330
- This is not a test. - Daddy!

1793
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:33,150
Daddy!

1794
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,190
One-minute warning.

1795
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,150
Wait. My son!

1796
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:40,120
I can see my son!

1797
02:18:40,390 --> 02:18:42,140
Save him, Max.

1798
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:45,180
I have to save my son.

1799
02:18:45,430 --> 02:18:46,640
Daddy!

1800
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:48,030
Alistair.

1801
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:49,600
Daddy!

1802
02:18:50,910 --> 02:18:52,170
Daddy!

1803
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:54,360
My... Alistair.

1804
02:18:56,710 --> 02:18:58,800
I renounce my wish!

1805
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:15,310
I renounce my wish.

1806
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:21,050
We have missiles disappearing, sir.

1807
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:25,240
Yes, sir. They are vanishing from our screen.

1808
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:30,880
Only just hearing now

1809
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:34,650
that a ceasefire between the Soviet Union and the United States

1810
02:19:34,650 --> 02:19:37,400
has averted a global nuclear crisis.

1811
02:19:39,150 --> 02:19:40,280
I renounce my wish.

1812
02:19:58,480 --> 02:20:00,400
- I take back my wish. - I renounce my wish.

1813
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:24,200
Alistair!

1814
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:32,390
Alistair!

1815
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:36,060
Alistair!

1816
02:20:38,770 --> 02:20:39,730
Daddy!

1817
02:20:46,230 --> 02:20:48,030
- Daddy! - Alistair!

1818
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:53,150
Alistair.

1819
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:59,040
Alistair, Alistair.

1820
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:00,920
I'm so sorry, baby.

1821
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:05,800
I'm so glad I wished you'd come.

1822
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:07,760
I knew it would work.

1823
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:11,430
No.

1824
02:21:12,970 --> 02:21:14,720
That is not why I'm back.

1825
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:16,320
No.

1826
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:19,980
I've been lying to you.

1827
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:23,610
I'm not a great guy.

1828
02:21:25,530 --> 02:21:28,110
In fact, I'm a pretty messed up, loser guy.

1829
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:32,240
And I made terrible mistakes.

1830
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:34,950
But you...

1831
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:40,580
you don't ever have to make a wish for me to love you.

1832
02:21:42,830 --> 02:21:44,750
I'm here because I love you.

1833
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:48,380
I just...

1834
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:51,910
I just wish and I pray that, one day,

1835
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:53,490
I'll be able to make you proud enough

1836
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:55,290
that you'll be able to forgive me.

1837
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:58,730
And love me.

1838
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:02,320
Because I'm nothing to be proud of, Alistair.

1839
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:05,280
I don't need you to make me proud.

1840
02:22:05,860 --> 02:22:07,530
I already love you, Daddy.

1841
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:09,440
You're my dad.

1842
02:22:57,740 --> 02:22:59,830
- Sorry. Sorry. - Sorry.

1843
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:03,000
It's okay. It's okay.

1844
02:23:07,710 --> 02:23:09,210
So beautiful.

1845
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:18,850
Sorry. Just talking to myself.

1846
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:23,060
It's all right.

1847
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:25,190
It's just that...

1848
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:31,020
It's wonderful. It's so many things.

1849
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:32,510
Yeah.

1850
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:35,610
I know what you mean.

1851
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:42,620
I like your...

1852
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:45,250
I like your outfit.

1853
02:23:45,580 --> 02:23:46,550
You like...

1854
02:23:47,210 --> 02:23:48,130
Thanks.

1855
02:23:48,460 --> 02:23:49,340
You know, my friends...

1856
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:53,460
they kinda tease me about it, but it works, right?

1857
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:55,340
- You look great. - Thank you.

1858
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,180
You just made my day.

1859
02:24:05,940 --> 02:24:08,570
- Happy holidays. See you around. - Happy holidays.

1860
02:24:48,890 --> 02:24:50,900
So many things.

1861
02:24:54,570 --> 02:24:57,110
So, so many things.

1863
02:26:35,110 --> 02:26:35,820
Look out!

1864
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:40,250
Oh, my God.

1865
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:43,660
- Mom, would you take her? - Yeah.

1866
02:26:44,340 --> 02:26:45,260
Excuse me.

1867
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:48,390
Excuse me. Please, you have to let me thank you, Miss...

1868
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:51,020
Asteria.

1869
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:52,280
Asteria.

1870
02:26:53,150 --> 02:26:54,100
That's a beautiful name.

1871
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:55,440
It's from my culture.

1872
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:57,690
I can't thank you enough. I mean, you saved my daughter.

1873
02:26:58,320 --> 02:26:59,900
How did you do that?

1874
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:03,950
It's just a simple shift of weight. Takes practice.

1875
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:07,120
But I've been doing this a long time.
